All	courses Course)
 	30	minutes
This	30	minute	course	covers	the	principles	of	the	Open	Data	for	Resilience	Initiative.
In	2011,	Global	Facility	for	Disaster	Reduction	and	Recovery	(GFDRR)	launched	the	Open	Data	for	Resilience
Initiative	(OpenDRI)	to	apply	the	concepts	of	the	global	open	data	movement	to	the	challenges	of	reducing
vulnerability	to	natural	hazards	and	the	impacts	of	climate	change.	OpenDRI	supports	World	Bank	Regional
Disaster	Risk	Management	Teams	to	build	capacity	and	long-term	ownership	of	open	data	projects	with	client
countries	that	are	tailored	to	meet	specific	needs	and	goals	of	stakeholders.
OpenDRI	engages	with	client	governments	in	three	main	areas.
(1)	Sharing	data:	To	increase	public	access	to	risk	information,	OpenDRI	engages	in	dialogue	with	governments
on	the	value	of	open	data	through	working	groups,	pilot	projects	that	evolve	into	long-term	locally	owned	open
data	projects.
(2)	Collecting	Data:	To	engage	communities	in	the	creation	of	accurate	and	timely	data	about	the	rapidly	evolving
urban	and	rural	environments	in	the	place	they	live,	OpenDRI	works	with	governments	and	local	communities	to
utilize	simple,	collaborative,	crowdsourcing	mapping	tools	such	as	OpenStreetMap	(OSM).
(3)	Using	data:	To	communicate	risk	more	effectively	to	decision-makers	in	planning,	preparedness	and	response
activities,	OpenDRI	works	with	governments	and	partners	to	develop	InaSAFE	software.
