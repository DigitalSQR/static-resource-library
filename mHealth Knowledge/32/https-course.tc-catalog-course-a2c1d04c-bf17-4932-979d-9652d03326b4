Nearly all of us are responsible for producing reports for our colleagues, supervisors, and clients. Good data visualization is essential to analyzing your data quickly and making an impact on those who see it.</p></div><div class="catalogdetails-maincontent pt-3"><div><h3>Course Description </h3><div><p>The importance of data visualization has become apparent in the current era of ‘big data’ that we live in. Effectively visualizing data can lead to recognizing key information quicker and demonstrating impact more effectively.</p><p>This four-week online certificate course will focus on building skills and strategies to better visualize and analyze data using a variety of tech tools. It will feature live interactive guest expert presentations with leading M&amp;E practitioners, software developers, and data scientists. It will also include a unique hands-on learning environment with animated videos, technology demos, practical activities, networking events, immersive simulations and more.</p><p>Effective data visualization requires both critical thinking skills and technical skills. During this course, we’ll walk you through the step-by-step design process, which encompasses both skillsets.</p><iframe class="ql-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMyp8uxjlaY?showinfo=0" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>You’ll learn:</p><ul><li>What data visualization is and why our brains respond so well to graphics;</li><li>Which up-and-coming trends in the data presentation field and in software development worth paying attention to;</li><li>How to design charts that fit your unique stakeholders’ information needs and interests;</li><li>Which dissemination format is best for your project–like static graphs within reports, handouts, presentations, or infographics, or interactive graphs within dashboards, websites, animated videos, and GIFs;</li><li>Chart choosing tips, like which layouts are best for showcasing time series data, part-to-whole relationships, geographic patterns, or nested data;</li><li>Strategies for displaying qualitative and text-based data, like sentiment analysis, color-coding, timelines, calendars, and diagrams;</li><li>How to select and use software tools–Excel, R, Tableau, mapping programs, and more–that are best suited to your chart type of choice; and</li><li>Which default settings in your computer program need to be adjusted to ensure that your graph follows best practices. For example, you’ll learn how to write titles, subtitles, and annotations that capture your desired takeaway messages; how to highlight your key findings with color; and how to ensure that your visualizations are readable for viewers with colorblindness.</li></ul><p>Participants will create data visualizations and get feedback from the course’s experts, facilitators, and fellow participants. For example, during Week 1, you’ll consider your audience’s information needs, the dissemination format for your visualization, what types of data wrangling techniques are needed to get your dataset ready to visualize, and key data responsibility issues. During Week 2, you’ll learn to select the best chart types for your dataset–beyond the overused pie chart and bar chart–and you’ll begin prototyping your visualization. During Week 3, we’ll dive even heavier into tools, and you’ll hear from experts about Tableau, R, and more. During Week 4, you’ll continue editing your visualization to ensure that it follows best practices in alignment, color, text, and more.</p><p>Your viewers will understand your data at a glance and retain information for the long run. We hope to see you online in November!</p><p>For a more detailed syllabus,&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/163MCB_Pwai1IB4hYPfDdUvcAlL20jxgQy-CzDRnLgwc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">please click here</a>.</p></div></div><div><h3>Course Topics and Featured Tech</h3><div><ul><li>Data visualization fundamentals</li><li>Prototyping data visualizations</li><li>Qualitative data analysis/visualization</li><li>Key chart types for M&amp;E</li></ul></div></div><div><h3>Course Objectives</h3><div><p>At the conclusion of the course, participants will be able to:</p><ul><li>critically analyze both the opportunities and the pitfalls that emerge when working with technology to visualize data.</li><li>connect relevant development theories to the technological strategies and tools discussed in the course.</li><li>manage specific software platforms and tools for data visualization&nbsp;activities</li><li>design dynamic and effective strategies for using tools and platforms improve data visualization&nbsp;efforts.</li><li>develop critical self-confidence for working with technology to address data visualization&nbsp;challenges.</li></ul></div></div><div><h3>Course Methodology </h3><div><ul><li>This course is delivered entirely online over a period of four weeks.</li></ul><ul><li>This course features&nbsp;several live interactive expert presentations each week with leading practitioners, software developers, academics, and donors.</li></ul><ul><li>Every live event is recorded and archived for you to watch later.</li></ul><ul><li>This course&nbsp;also features a&nbsp;unique hands-on learning environment with animated videos, technology demos, practical activities, networking events, office hours, participant presentations, immersive simulations, and more.</li></ul><ul><li>TechChange recommends budgeting a minimum commitment of 5-7 hours per week and scheduling time for the course around your existing obligations.</li></ul><ul><li>Participants will have access to all course content for at least 4 months after course completion so the material can be completed and revisited later.</li></ul></div></div><div><h3>Price</h3><div><ul><li><strong>$395</strong>&nbsp;if application and payment is submitted <strong>September 19th, 2019</strong></li><li><strong>$445</strong>&nbsp;if application and payment is submitted <strong>October 19th, 2019</strong></li><li><strong>$495</strong>&nbsp;if application and payment is submitted by&nbsp;course start date</li></ul><p>Group discount rates available.

She ensures that CRC is responsive to client needs, provides accessible information, and makes life easier for the people we work with. Dr. Carson has been working in the field of evaluation since 1997 and has conducted evaluations with federal government programs; state, county, and city agencies and organizations; and nonprofits. She specializes in research and evaluation that can be used to improve organizations and program performance. She has extensive experience in all phases of evaluation, including logic model development, evaluation design, capacity building for evaluation, training, qualitative and quantitative methods, and data visualization. And that’s just the beginning. Prior to founding CRC she assisted with the development of logic models for national cross-site evaluations, including Safe Start and the Greenbook initiative through the Office of Justice Programs at the Department of Justice, and she helped build evaluation capacity for many state juvenile justice agencies through her work with the Juvenile Justice Evaluation Center. Dr. Carson has conducted evaluation trainings for hundreds of program staff and professionals all around the country and locally. With all this, it may not seem like she has much free time, but when she can, she makes time for the things she enjoys, like cycling, rowing and practicing her Spanish (preferably in foreign countries). And sometimes for fun, Taj swims with sharks, and people she wishes would get eaten by sharks.","image":"https://d2tnst4joh66uk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/taj_headshot-150x150.jpg","session_person":{"id":"944f799d-548d-4e46-a5fa-d76c43594929","type":"expert","weight":40,"created_at":"2016-09-21T19:12:14.603Z","updated_at":"2017-11-09T17:49:22.961Z","deleted_at":null,"person_id":"8c71ed34-23b6-48e5-be96-33dd266a5b26","session_id":"49170984-2c2c-4879-9a8e-3e591cca1392"}},{"id":"15bea09b-4964-41d1-b8e1-6acd40468b7e","name":"Marc A.

you analyzing your data efficiently and displaying them effectively? Nearly all of us are responsible for producing reports for our colleagues, supervisors, and clients. Good data visualization is essential to analyzing your data quickly and making an impact on those who see it.</p>","content_main":[{"body":"<p>The importance of data visualization has become apparent in the current era of ‘big data’ that we live in. Effectively visualizing data can lead to recognizing key information quicker and demonstrating impact more effectively.</p><p>This four-week online certificate course will focus on building skills and strategies to better visualize and analyze data using a variety of tech tools. It will feature live interactive guest expert presentations with leading M&amp;E practitioners, software developers, and data scientists. It will also include a unique hands-on learning environment with animated videos, technology demos, practical activities, networking events, immersive simulations and more.</p><p>Effective data visualization requires both critical thinking skills and technical skills. During this course, we’ll walk you through the step-by-step design process, which encompasses both skillsets.</p><iframe class=\"ql-video\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMyp8uxjlaY?showinfo=0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p>You’ll learn:</p><ul><li>What data visualization is and why our brains respond so well to graphics;</li><li>Which up-and-coming trends in the data presentation field and in software development worth paying attention to;</li><li>How to design charts that fit your unique stakeholders’ information needs and interests;</li><li>Which dissemination format is best for your project–like static graphs within reports, handouts, presentations, or infographics, or interactive graphs within dashboards, websites, animated videos, and GIFs;</li><li>Chart choosing tips, like which layouts are best for showcasing time series data, part-to-whole relationships, geographic patterns, or nested data;</li><li>Strategies for displaying qualitative and text-based data, like sentiment analysis, color-coding, timelines, calendars, and diagrams;</li><li>How to select and use software tools–Excel, R, Tableau, mapping programs, and more–that are best suited to your chart type of choice; and</li><li>Which default settings in your computer program need to be adjusted to ensure that your graph follows best practices. For example, you’ll learn how to write titles, subtitles, and annotations that capture your desired takeaway messages; how to highlight your key findings with color; and how to ensure that your visualizations are readable for viewers with colorblindness.</li></ul><p>Participants will create data visualizations and get feedback from the course’s experts, facilitators, and fellow participants. For example, during Week 1, you’ll consider your audience’s information needs, the dissemination format for your visualization, what types of data wrangling techniques are needed to get your dataset ready to visualize, and key data responsibility issues. During Week 2, you’ll learn to select the best chart types for your dataset–beyond the overused pie chart and bar chart–and you’ll begin prototyping your visualization. During Week 3, we’ll dive even heavier into tools, and you’ll hear from experts about Tableau, R, and more. During Week 4, you’ll continue editing your visualization to ensure that it follows best practices in alignment, color, text, and more.</p><p>Your viewers will understand your data at a glance and retain information for the long run.

She ensures that CRC is responsive to client needs, provides accessible information, and makes life easier for the people we work with. Dr. Carson has been working in the field of evaluation since 1997 and has conducted evaluations with federal government programs; state, county, and city agencies and organizations; and nonprofits. She specializes in research and evaluation that can be used to improve organizations and program performance. She has extensive experience in all phases of evaluation, including logic model development, evaluation design, capacity building for evaluation, training, qualitative and quantitative methods, and data visualization. And that’s just the beginning. Prior to founding CRC she assisted with the development of logic models for national cross-site evaluations, including Safe Start and the Greenbook initiative through the Office of Justice Programs at the Department of Justice, and she helped build evaluation capacity for many state juvenile justice agencies through her work with the Juvenile Justice Evaluation Center. Dr. Carson has conducted evaluation trainings for hundreds of program staff and professionals all around the country and locally. With all this, it may not seem like she has much free time, but when she can, she makes time for the things she enjoys, like cycling, rowing and practicing her Spanish (preferably in foreign countries). And sometimes for fun, Taj swims with sharks, and people she wishes would get eaten by sharks.","image":"https://d2tnst4joh66uk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/taj_headshot-150x150.jpg","session_person":{"id":"944f799d-548d-4e46-a5fa-d76c43594929","type":"expert","weight":40,"created_at":"2016-09-21T19:12:14.603Z","updated_at":"2017-11-09T17:49:22.961Z","deleted_at":null,"person_id":"8c71ed34-23b6-48e5-be96-33dd266a5b26","session_id":"49170984-2c2c-4879-9a8e-3e591cca1392"}},{"id":"15bea09b-4964-41d1-b8e1-6acd40468b7e","name":"Marc A.
