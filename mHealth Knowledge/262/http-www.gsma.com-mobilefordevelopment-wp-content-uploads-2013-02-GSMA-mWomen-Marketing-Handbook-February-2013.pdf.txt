A mobile gender gap has emerged, resulting in lost commercial and 
social opportunity 
• A woman is 21% less likely to own a mobile phone than a man in low- to middle-income countries 
• As a result, many women in these countries still do not benefit from the positive impact that owning a mobile phone 
can have on their lives and livelihoods 
• The 300 million missing female subscribers represent a US$13.3 billion missed market opportunity for MNOs

Several barriers hinder women’s use of phones 
• The total cost of ownership inhibits low-income women from investing in mobile tools: 
 Handset 
Cost 
 Services (SIM and communication features) 
 Power (cost of recharging the handset’s battery) 
• Women’s use of phones can be perceived as challenging to traditional cultures 
Culture • Women are sometimes the last in resource-poor household to obtain a phone 
• Technical illiteracy, including the inability to read or to know how to use a phone, limits 
Technical illiteracy a woman’s ability to access the full suite of available services 
• Resource-poor women’s priorities are family health, education and economic 
opportunities and will value mobile services that meet these needs

This handbook aims to equip mobile network operators to address the 
gender gap by marketing more effectively to resource-poor women 
• Target audience:  the handbook will be helpful to mobile network operators (MNOs) which are pursuing resource- 
poor women as market opportunities as part of their global marketing strategies 
– Resource-poor is defined as women in low- and middle-income countries who may experience one or more 
of the following1: 
o Low income 
o Low level of empowerment 
o Limited access to education 
o Social isolation due to limited mobility or remote locations 
 
• Approach:  Build on lessons and case studies from mobile and non-mobile industries, as well as social enterprises 
and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
– Primary research 
o Interviews with non-MNO organizations: ad agencies, fast moving consumer goods companies, NGOs 
and other international organizations in emerging markets 
o Interviews with C-level executives from MNOs with experience serving women in emerging markets 
o Country visits to India, Kenya and Uganda to conduct interviews 
– Secondary research 
o Review of existing GSMA mWomen material 
o Literature review on marketing to women 
 
1. Note that ‘resource-poor’ is not a measurable or universally used term; the programme has identified the definition above to help clarify the focus of its work

A key success factor for marketing to resource-poor women is strategic 
and effective partnership (I) 
Consider both traditional and non-traditional partnerships to market to resource-poor women 
• Traditional partners include commercial value-added service (VAS) providers, handset manufacturers, retail distribution outlets 
and others that are part of the day-to-day mobile ecosystem 
• Non-traditional partners may include organizations that have experience, skills or access to resource-poor women 
– Types of organizations 
o Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
o Social enterprises, or organizations seeking sustainable business models that create social value 
o International organizations such as United Nations agencies 
o Governments providing services such as health or agricultural training 
– Potential value of such partnerships 
o Experience marketing to hard-to-reach populations 
o Experience working with communities 
o Relationships with key influencers in hard-to-reach communities 
o Techniques for gaining consumer insights 
o Existing insights about target consumers

A key success factor for marketing to resource-poor women is strategic 
and effective partnership (II) 
Perform due diligence on new, non-traditional partners, with particular focus on the following elements 
• Demonstrated track record of excellence 
– MNOs’ brands are vulnerable if partners do not deliver quality  
– MNOs should carefully vet a potential partner’s track record and references 
• Organizational fit 
– MNOs can expect NGOs and government partners to have different organizational cultures and operating norms  
– Due diligence therefore should focus on key attributes the MNO most values, e.g. speed, quality 
• Aligned interests 
– Consider whether the potential partner would be remaining true to its core mission, or whether the partnership falls outside 
this mission and hence lead to delivery or commitment issues 
• Organizational capacity 
– Test whether the core skills are aligned to the partners’ role in the partnership 
– Test whether this partnership will exceed the organization’s capacity to deliver 
– Partners with too many donors or other partners may be stretched to deliver 
 
Establish objectives and expectations early on 
• Any partnership is vulnerable if clear objectives and expectations are not established early on 
• This is a particular risk when working with an non-traditional partner, especially one that doesn’t have experience with MNOs 
• An upfront time investment can save a great deal of time and money later by ensuring alignment and avoiding missteps

Generate consumer insights Develop the product Brand and promote Distribute and sell 
1 Formulate analysis and  Key insights 
research objectives • Set clear, concrete objectives for your consumer insights analysis  
• Research objectives should cover all stages of the marketing strategy, including 
segmentation, product design, branding and media consumption, buying and consumption 
2 Leverage existing data behaviors and preferred distribution channels 
• Start by leveraging your existing data, as it often helps address many of the research 
objectives and will limit the need for additional, custom research 
3 
Narrow research objectives • Prioritize segments based on the company’s global market strategy and positioning, size of 
business opportunity, ease of access, etc. 
• While researching target segments, seek insights on their wants and needs in terms of 
content and services, pricing and marketing touch points 
4 Launch additional  
research as needed 
5 Segment the market 
and set priorities 
GSMA mWomen_proposed M&E outcomes for discussion_23 April 2012 12 
GSMA mWomen Marketing Handbook 
The first step to defining an mWomen initiative is to ask ‘what do we 
need to know about women?’ 
1 • Key insights to generate at this stage: 
− Women’s current ownership and usage patterns relative to the market, e.g.  
the share of women in the customer base, in gross additions, churners, etc.  
− Women’s wants and needs, e.g. data and insights on what women value in their 
2 
Formulate lives and from mobile tools and services, e.g. purchasing criteria, satisfaction 
objectives and levels, etc. 
translate them into − Opportunities to overcome barriers to uptake, e.g. economic or other decision 
3 research questions drivers, media habits, intentions to buy/use, etc. 
• Translate these research objectives into concrete questions for analysis 
− E.g. ‘Do women have the same calling pattern during the day? And if not, how 
relevant is our off-peak pricing to them?’ 
4 
• Use these questions to determine the best methods and sources to generate answers 
• MNOs frequently express the belief that reliable data on women doesn’t exist or 
Challenge the requires large investment in ad hoc research 
5 
perception that data ‘We know we have to look actively at the women segment…the problem is that 
on women doesn’t it’s a black hole for us…we know nothing about this segment and there is no 
exist spare budget for further research’ 
-Marketing executive of an MNO 
GSMA mWomen_proposed M&E outcomes for discussion_23 April 2012 13 
GSMA mWomen Marketing Handbook 
Many research objectives can be fulfilled by analyzing existing data and 
market research 
1 • Before investing in new research, explore existing data and research to find answers 
– E.g. brand trackers, consumer satisfaction surveys, segmentation studies 
– Such analyses allow operators to compare women to the overall market, providing insight on 
Perform new analysis women users’/non-users’ brand awareness, key purchasing criteria, etc. 
2 on existing data • However, biases in market research methodologies may exist and need to be properly factored in 
– E.g. phone-based surveys should be used with caution, as women often are less likely than men to 
take calls from phone interviewers, particularly if men 
 
3 • O ften Customer Registration Information (CRI) obtained during SIM sales is the only easily accessible 
 data operators have for women. However, this data generally is of poor quality, either incorrect or 
improperly stored 
• This issue is compounded in the case of women since SIMs often are registered under the name of 
4 Beware of CRI data husbands, brothers or other male relatives, particularly in conservative settings where cultural norms may 
discourage women’s use of mobile 
• Therefore operators should avoid using CRI data unless they are confident of its reliability 
5 • Disaggregation by gender is quite common in research  
Include gender splits in • For example, as phone- or field-based research in MSISDNs1 are collected, disaggregate women 
all future data interviewees’ MSISDNs so usage data over 6-12 months can be analyzed and compared to men

Refine objectives to determine need and design fresh research to fill 
gaps remaining after analysis of existing data  
1 • One limitation of MNOs’ existing quantitative data and research is the lack of behavioral insights, i.e. 
WHY consumers behave as they do, e.g. 
– Why is women’s off net/on net ratio so different to men’s? 
– Why do they purchase different products? 
2 
– Why don’t existing above-the-line campaigns reach them? 
Seek to understand 
• Qualitative research, including focus group discussions (FGDs) and one-on-one, in-depth interviews help 
‘why?’ through 
answer these behavioral questions 
qualitative research 
3 – Good practice is to perform qualitative research on a representative sample of women from 
various segments or demographic groups 
– It’s also good practice to include men, both to understand how they may influence women’s 
purchase decisions, but also to offer market wide comparisons 
4 
• The goal is to understand both how women are similar and different to men, as well as how 
women may differ from one another 
5 – Including, e.g. detailed sizing, market share, segmentation, purchasing criteria, satisfaction 
Analyze existing and drivers, etc. 
new data to build a map • The analysis should include drivers and barriers of both mobile ownership and usage 
of the women’s market – In some cases, women may own a phone for reasons such as security or communication 
with distant family, but may not understand or appreciate the full range of services available 
on a phone, thereby limiting usage

Research findings will inform a segmentation of the women’s market, 
enabling prioritization and design of segment strategies 
1 • A market segmentation should group individuals with shared characteristics, needs, 
behaviours and aspirations to inform product design and distribution strategies 
• In general, segmentation is performed along a blend of dimensions: 
Segment the market 
– Usage, e.g. high SMS senders vs. international callers vs. off-net addicts, etc. 
2 
– Socio-demographics, e.g. youth, urban, middle-income, etc. 
– Attitudes, e.g. ‘adventure seekers’, ‘moderns’, ‘tech crazy’, etc. 
• Profiles of each women’s segment should include at least the following: 
3 
– Current status along key metrics, e.g. mobile penetration, market share, average 
ARPU (operator vs. competitor), performance on brand and satisfaction key 
Build a profile of performance indicators (KPIs), etc. 
4 each segment  – Performance potential in terms of increased ownership (by sales to non-users, or 
by churning competitor’s customers), and increased usage via new products 
– Other benefits to stability on the subscriber base, long-term growth potential, 
brand equity and other factors that align the MNOs several strategy 
5 
• MNOs can use these profiles to prioritize segments, using criteria that align with

Meeting women’s wants and needs will help increase demand for mobile 
Example: creating tools that create a sense of security 
1 • Mobile  can enhance security and perceptions of security for women users and their families 
- 93% of women asked in a GSMA mWomen study1 cited safety as a key positive outcome and 
feeling associated with mobile phone ownership 
- Increased security of the phone itself may also help women and in some cases their male 
household members feel more comfortable with the phone 
2 
o E.g. harassment over the phone is an ongoing challenge in some markets 
• VAS can help meet this need for a sense of security 
- Some operators address harassment by introducing a call and SMS block service and by offering 
the possibility to buy credit without providing the phone number 
3 o E.g. Robi in Bangladesh has developed a specific offer for women,  Anonna 27, which 
enables women to get emergency balance for urgent situations 
Meeting women’s needs for security: Zong Flutter Women Package (Pakistan)2 
• In July 2012, Zong launched Flutter, its first package for women 
4 • In addition to an attractive communications package, it includes specific VAS to protect                                         
women from phone harassment and to help them protect their rights: 
- Zong Call and SMS block services that offer the option to block any incoming call                                                             
and SMS from specific phone numbers 
- Flutter Lounge, which offers SMS-based access to advice on various topics from a panel of experts, as well as 
a  ‘Know your Rights” service to educate women users on their rights (App k Haqooq)

Meeting women’s wants and needs will help increase demand for mobile 
Example: designing communications packages based on women’s wants and needs 
1 • Operators may consider developing attractive communication packages based on women’s consumption 
patterns: 
- Where data suggests women tend to use voice services for social and family calls more than men, they 
may value packages that offer more time and SMS, as well as off-peak flexibility 
- Tariffs for women can encourage customer loyalty for the whole family, possibility to have a shared credit 
2 
account and to be able to transfer credit from one phone to another 
 
Package reflecting women’s usage: Almas Line women package by AsiaCell (Iraq)1 
3 Based on research insights about the women’s market, AsiaCell created Almas, featuring 
• 50% discount after the 3rd minute of each call on the Asiacell network, and at the reduced cost of 
IQD 1/second2 
- This feature was incorporated after observing – via data-analytics – that women made 
fewer calls per day, but that call duration was way longer than for men 
4 • 50% discount on calls at IQD 1/second during one selected off-peak period of the day 
- This innovation was based on analysis findings that traffic patterns for women varied 
significantly between men and women and amongst various women’s segments 
• Low calling rates to all other networks at IQD 3.5/second

Meeting women’s wants and needs will help increase demand for mobile 
Example: offering handsets that meet women’s wants and needs and reduce barriers to adoption 
1 • In some instances, women’s first phone is a second-hand purchase or a gift from a family member who upgrades 
to a new phone 
• Offering or promote good value handsets with appropriate features can help reduce barriers to adoption for 
women: 
- Offer handsets that reflect the segment’s ability to pay

MVNOs and MNO sub-brands may be efficient cost-effective solutions for 
operators interested in serving women 
• Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) and MNO sub-brands have not yet gained

the same momentum in emerging markets as in mature markets 
• However, with emerging market moving towards maturity and regulations evolving, 
these alternatives could soon provide a new platform for MNOs to partner with 
women-oriented brands, in order to 
2 
- Build a strong brand identity appealing to the women segment 
- Encourage the adoption by creating a strong sense of “community” 
- Rely on both their distribution network and communication vehicles to deliver tailored offerings and 
messages in the most efficient way 
3 - While limiting the risk of cannibalization from the MNO’s other generic offerings 
Launching brands to reach women: Examples in Africa1 
• MVNO Set’mobile, launched in Cameroon in late 2011  
- Set’mobile capitalizes on the image of the country’s world-famous footballer Samuel Eto’o 
4 to appeal to the football-enthusiastic male segment 
- Though Set’mobile relies on Orange Cameroon’s network, it has developed its own brand, 
offers and distribution network 
• MNO sub-brand Touba2 mobile of Senegalese MNO expresso launched in early 2011 and 
positions itself as a low-cost offer with a closed user group and a target market among the Mouride
