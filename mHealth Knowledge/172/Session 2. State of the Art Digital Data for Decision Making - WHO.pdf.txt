Universal	  Health	  Coverage
“All	  people,	  irrespec-ve	  of	  
socioeconomic	  status,	  should	  have	  
access	  to	  quality	  health	  services	  
they	  need,	  without	  incurring	  
financial	  hardship.”
Universal	  Health	  Coverage	  
Core	  Principles
Coverage
Quality
Affordability
Responsive	  accountability
Elements	  criMcal	  to	  success:
• Knowing	  who	  is	  in	  need	  of	  services,	  having	  
the	  necessary	  human	  resources	  and	  
commodi?es	  in	  adequate	  supply,	  and	  
connecMng	  these	  together	  at	  the	  right	  ?me	  
and	  place.
