#4 : Identify & Monitor Lessons Learned
• Implement monitoring approaches 
to identify and capture digital 
solution implementation lessons 
learned (e.g. data analytics, 
benchmarking, passenger surveys)
• Share lessons learned widely with 
Travel & Tourism stakeholders to 
enable continuous improvement, best 
practices to be identified and rapid 
adaption to changing circumstances

and risks
Summary
Many of the building blocks are already in place
1. Digital COVID Certificates → align to 1 of 4 standards (& work towards a single 
standard in mid term)
2. Passenger Location Form (PLF) Portals & eVisa/eTA Portals → build upon to make 
an integrated Digital Travel Portal
3. API & iAPI systems →  utilise iAPI for COVID Status Checks & upgrade API systems
4. National Verification Apps → allow Digital Travel Authorisation Certificates (TAC)    
& define a standard for TAC’s
5. Supporting Policies → Build on existing policies to implement Counter Fraud,  
Digital Accessibility, Digital Government & Healthcare Services and Lessons 
Learned Policies
