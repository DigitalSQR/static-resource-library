Safer Deliveries in Zanzibar
Overarching goal: To reduce maternal and 
neonatal morbidity and mortality
Aim (Primary): To increase facility delivery 
and skilled attendance at birth
Secondary: Increase postnatal care
Addressing the ‘three 
delays’ to facility delivery:
● The decision to seek care
● The transfer to a facility
● Treatment at the facility

All on one device
Using a mobile phone, CHWs:
• Register pregnant women and permissions from 
decision makers at home
• Agree on an birth plans based on established risk factors
• Counsel mothers and families on healthy behaviors and 
danger signs
• Screen pregnant mothers to identify danger signs and 
refer as needed
• Coordinate transport, call facility staff, escort mother
• Pay for transport to health facilities using mobile 
banking for labor and complications
• Monitor mother and baby up to 10 days after delivery to 
ensure a continuum of care
How we use mobile money
• Transfer funds from D-tree to Community 
Health Worker (CHW) accounts
• CHW organizes transportation and pays 
drivers from account using mobile money
• CHW withdraws their incentive at end of 
month
• Audit transactions using application records, 
mobile money accounts and sign-in books at 
health facilities

Results
• Worked with 223 CHWs, 51 supervisors and 200 
community drivers
• Coverage area: 45% of rural population of 
Zanzibar
• 75% facility delivery rate for 13,323 women who 
delivered compared to 35% baseline
• Increased use of primary facilities, from 4% (HMIS) 
to 44% of deliveries
• Post-partum follow up rates from 36% to 88%
• More than 40,000 mobile money transactions
Mobile Money Challenges
• Forecasting transport costs
– Use Burn rate vs EDD
• Tracking funds
– Develop tracking system
• Limited financial reports from MNO 
– Continued dialogue with Zantel
• Limited penetration of pay points in rural 
areas
Next steps
• Scale up program to all of Zanzibar and pilot in 
mainland Tanzania
• Continue efforts to mainstream into MOH
• API connectivity/centralized payments
• Design systems for automatic verification of 
referrals (NFC tokens, barcodes, biometrics)
• Explore various financial models
– District funding
– Mobile maternity wallets
– Digital community savings groups
