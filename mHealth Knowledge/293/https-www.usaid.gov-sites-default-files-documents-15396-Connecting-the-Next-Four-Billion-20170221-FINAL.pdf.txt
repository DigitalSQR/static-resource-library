PREFACE 
We live in a world where the Internet is increasingly integrated into our daily lives. Beyond getting online through 
computers or mobile devices, wrist bands track our daily exercise, and smart thermostats moderate our home climates. 
Even more importantly, much of our work and many of our transactions are conducted online, from communicating with our 
friends and coworkers, to ordering dinner, to flagging where a pot hole or fire hydrant needs to be fixed in our local 
community. As embedded as the Internet has become for many of us, it seems almost inconceivable that so many—over 
half of the world’s population—have never gotten online. 
This demonstrates a strong truth: The Internet is no longer additive to our daily lives; it is becoming essential. For those 
who do not access it, they risk greater losses than a cold home or undocumented exercise. They risk missing out on 
society’s continued advances. 
This realization—that the digital divide remains wide and, more importantly, that its consequences will be grave and far-
reaching—is why we have recently seen a sharp increase in attention from the global community, and development actors 
specifically, on achieving universal access. But attention and broad mandates to address this issue are not enough. As the 
international community struggles to develop a unified strategy around how a diverse set of actors—from policymakers to 
industry players to civil society members—will coordinate their activities, this paper was commissioned to identify some of 
the ways that this community can take action with greatest impact. What follows, therefore, is an analysis of remaining 
gaps in the global access effort and a set of clear recommendations on where there are opportunities for catalytic impact, 
in order to best channel the upswing in attention toward efforts that will move the needle on universal access.  
We know that Internet access for the world’s last billion is both critical and within reach. Yet this vision cannot be realized 
without collective action that prioritizes Internet access on the development agenda, helps last billion business models 
reach scale, and invests in understanding what works and what does not.  
Today, the Internet is the basis for a dynamic global conversation and bustling economic activity. Imagine what it could be 
if the other half of the world’s population joined in.

Recognizing the growing importance of access to the Internet 
– President Obama, Global Entrepreneurship as foundational to global socioeconomic development, the 
Summit 2016 international community has begun to focus more attention on 
the issue, through both new strategic initiatives and ambitious 
targets such as that of the UN Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) to achieve universal access by 2020. 
To better inform investments in access and connectivity by the international development community, the Digital Impact 
Alliance (DIAL)1 requested SSG Advisors to assess the global response to increasing access to information and 
communication technology (ICT) and the Internet in least developed countries (LDCs). Building on a previous report, titled 
Connecting the Last Billion: Market Approaches to Increasing Internet Access,2 and understanding that the business 
models that were the focus of that assessment were only one part of the solution to the challenge of universal access, 
SSG sought to better understand the key gaps in the global effort to expand Internet access. 
The outcome of this analysis is meant to provide policymakers, industry, and global development actors with a high-level 
understanding of the access challenge, the current players working and efforts being undertaken to increase access, gaps 
in global response, and, most importantly, actionable recommendations regarding how those gaps might best be closed. 
Building on existing research, therefore, this paper determined primary barriers to access, and used an examination of the 
landscape of existing efforts and actors to identify gaps in response and steps that decision makers could take to address 
these gaps. Existing literature demonstrated a strong consensus around four key barriers to access: infrastructure, 
affordability, user capabilities, and incentives. A review of the landscape of actors and initiatives led to a list of seven 
primary roles that actors are playing to address these barriers: convening, funding, research, advocacy, technology 
deployment, business model development, and building capacity (See Chart on Pg. 7 for a summary). 
This research reveals an encouraging range of efforts, large and small, focused on promoting greater access to the 
Internet. Some of these efforts are proving effective in bringing ever-larger numbers of users online in real and meaningful 
ways. Other efforts are helping to shine a light on the access challenge, creating the impetus for policymakers, industry 
leaders, and others to take action. Although the international response thus far has been encouraging, our analysis also 
revealed significant gaps in global response that, if left unaddressed, will slow, or in some cases even impede, progress 
toward universal access. These include a greater need to operationalize global agendas, promote business models, curate 
best practices, research new technologies, and fund activities. 
Three clear recommendations emerged that would allow the international development actors to take advantage of their 
respective capabilities and tools in order to serve as catalysts for spurring growth in access for the most vulnerable 
populations, particularly in LDCs. 
1. Mainstream Access Across the Development Agenda, both through building capacity to make access a priority 
across development organizations and within host governments, and through the development of an economic 
impact model to clearly demonstrate the beneficial impacts of increased access.

3. Develop Consistency in Approaches to Digital Access, through researching and establishing a collection of best

As the global community approaches the third decade of the 21st century, the importance of the Internet in our social, 
economic, and political lives will only continue to grow. The prospect of billions of the most vulnerable people left without 
access and, therefore, unable to participate fully in our increasingly digitally intermediated world ought to be cause for 
alarm for policymakers, industry, and civil society alike. The recommendations in this report are a call to action for building 
on the progress to date and ensuring that the global community focuses on Internet access as a foundational element for 
sustained socioeconomic development.

A growing body of empirical evidence suggests that

With organizations forming new projects within the 
access and connectivity space at an increasing rate, 
these projects and interventions are sometimes coordinated with each other, but also often act in isolation. Identifying and 
matching the resources that stakeholders across government, industry, and the development community can bring to their work 
with the needed interventions can help all those seeking to increase access to work more effectively. Therefore, DIAL asked SSG 
Advisors to analyze the current global landscape of actors and interventions to better understand where there may be gaps in the 
global response, and how those gaps might be best addressed. 
Drawing on the insights of the existing community of thinkers and practitioners, SSG sought to answer the following four core 
questions to determine what a meaningful role in the access space would look like: 
 What are the primary barriers to 
access? Definitions  
 What is the existing landscape of efforts

landscape of efforts to increase Internet access, assess gaps in the global response, and identify opportunities for catalytic action 
for new or existing global development actors.

ACCESS: CURRENT REALITIES AND BARRIERS 
The Current Reality 
Connectivity and ICT:  
Increasing in Importance to Policymakers and the International Community 
Policymakers are becoming increasingly more aware of the value of Internet access, both at home and around the world: 
 In September 2016 the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation to help promote Internet access in 
developing countries. According to the Digital Global Access Policy Act of 2016, (HR5537. Digital GAP Act) “the 
internet offers tremendous opportunities—for those that have access to it.” A similar bill has been introduced in 
the Senate: The Driving Innovation and Growth in Internet Technology and Launching Universal Access to the 
Global Economy Act (The DIGITAL AGE Act).   
 President Obama also issued an Executive Order at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in June 2016, outlining 
the need for investment and programs focused on entrepreneurship, with several sections focused specifically on 
global Internet access. Specifically, through the U.S. State Department Global Connect Initiative (GCI), this 
executive order asks “foreign countries to prioritize Internet connectivity in development plans, promoting the 
formation of region-specific multi-sector working groups to ensure technical and regulatory best practices, and 
encouraging the development of digital literacy programs in developing nations.” 
 At the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) 2014 Plenipotentiary Conference, Member States 
unanimously adopted the Connect 2020 agenda, which commits these Member States to work toward the shared 
vision of "an information society, empowered by the interconnected world, where telecommunication/ICT enables 
and accelerates socially, economically and environmentally sustainable growth and development for everyone." 
 The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 9c, calls to “significantly increase access to information and 
communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least 
developed countries by 2020.”  
 
With the advent of the new SDGs, as well as a growing list of initiatives and mandates around Internet connectivity, the 
goal of universal access has been gaining visibility within the global community, and with good cause. The potential to 
increase GDP by expanding Internet access (along with the requisite complementary systems) is well documented through 
numerous case studies as well as data from the World Bank.3 Emerging empirical evidence also links increased Internet 
access, and digitization more broadly, with socio-political benefits in education, political participation, and governance 
transparency, creating net gains in the Human Development Index.4 The mainstreamed integration of digital services into 
the global economy means that those without access not only lose the potential for further development, but may also lose 
opportunities to communicate or collaborate with the parts of the globe that have transitioned to a more fully digitized 
means of operating.  
                                                          
3 Estimates from the World Bank find that “ICT capital accounted for nearly one-fifth of global growth, 1995–2014” (World Development Report, 
2016), and a “10% increase in mobile broadband penetration drives a 1.4% increase in GDP for low-to-middle income countries” (Kim et al., 
2010).

and the distribution of access – across nations, regions, and communities According to industry observers, 
(emerging markets versus LDCs, urban versus rural, middle-income versus declining average revenue per user 
poor, male versus female)?  (ARPU) and the ongoing need to 
upgrade network infrastructure buildout, 
particularly in rural areas, make 
extending access increasingly hard to monetize.7  
This, in turn, can further exacerbate other types of inequality for so-called “last-mile” users, as more rural and less densely 
populated areas that are also often poorer will have less access to the tools and resources available online that can help 
create both economic and social growth.8 Those left offline, therefore, will be the most vulnerable populations in the LDCs; 
the vast majority of the unconnected are the urban poor, marginalized groups (women in particular), and rural residents—
precisely the groups the development community is most trying to assist.9  
 
Key Barriers to Internet Access 
Given the global development community’s increasing recognition of the importance of digital access, why are 2.5 billion 
people projected to remain unconnected?10 What barriers are inhibiting access in developing countries?  
SSG’s research found significant consensus regarding the principal barriers to increasing access: lack of infrastructure, 
low incomes and affordability, user capabilities (i.e., basic literacy and digital literacy), and incentives (i.e., cultural and 
                                                          
5 “The number of Internet users has more than tripled in a decade—from 1 billion in 2005 to an estimated 3.2 billion at the end of 2015” (World 
Development Report, 2016).

10 GSMA predicts that 2.5 billion will remain unconnected in its 2016 report, The Mobile Economy. In addition, in its report, Business Models for 
the Last Billion: Market Approaches to Increasing Internet Access, SSG forecast that the current mobile operator-dominated paradigm could 
have a serviceable market of an additional 1–2 billion users, most of whom are coming from areas where population density allows for enough 
return, through added users, to justify additional investment from operators in infrastructure buildout.

social acceptance of Internet use, awareness and understanding of the Internet, and available and attractive local 
content).11  
In the table below, SSG compares the barriers referenced in its analysis to those cited in seven major publications in 
recent years. There are some slight variations in the definitions of these four barriers. For example, cultural and social 
acceptance is included under “Readiness” by Internet.org and Strategy&, and User Capabilities and Incentives are 
combined into “Usage” in Ericsson and Columbia University’s ICT & SDGs report. However, there is general agreement on 
the primary barriers to access.

Lack of Infrastructure  
As the table above demonstrates, lack of infrastructure remains a key barrier to users’ ability to get online. This buildout is 
necessary at multiple levels, from laying new international deep sea cables to additional national cables, middle-mile 
buildout, intra-city networks, and last-mile infrastructure.13 It can take the form of mobile infrastructure (increased 3G, 4G, 
or even new 5G buildout) or fiber infrastructure, or it might follow other, more innovative delivery methods. For example, 
cheaper satellite options (including Medium-Earth Orbit satellite systems) could potentially replace middle-mile 
infrastructure, and the Google Loon project is aiming to extend middle-mile infrastructure with Wi-Fi-enabled balloons. For 
                                                          
11 With a goal to synthesize, not recreate, existing research, SSG chose to use the terminology put forward by McKinsey and Company in its 
Offline and Falling Behind report, which was also referenced by GSMA in its 2014 Digital Inclusion report.  
12 Note: GSMA references McKinsey’s framework (Infrastructure, Low Incomes and Affordability, User Capabilities, and Incentives) in its 2014 
Digital Inclusion report. However, as part of this report, GSMA decides to prioritize four different but related barriers for action, including 
Network Infrastructure and Policy (related to Infrastructure), Taxation (linked to Affordability), Consumer Barriers, including illiteracy, digital 
illiteracy, and awareness (linked to User Capabilities and Incentives), and Local Content (linked to Incentives).

Proposed Barriers 
 
now, these options are not cost-competitive in most markets, and projects such as Google Loon and the Facebook drone 
program (Aquila) are still in pilot stages.14 
The challenge of addressing this barrier is multilayered. It requires substantial investment, innovative technologies and 
business models, progressive National Broadband Plans, and close coordination between companies, donors, and host-
country governments. In addition, national policies, tax regimes, and regulations can either facilitate or hamper 
infrastructure buildout and related private sector investment. 
Low Incomes and Affordability  
The affordability barrier has two key components: user incomes, and the relative costs of devices, services, and data 
packages. The general consensus across key actors in the access space is that for telecom services and devices to be 
considered “affordable,” they must cost less than 5 percent of consumers’ monthly incomes.15  Although, historically, the 
price of devices has been a major barrier to access, the proliferation of low-cost feature-phones and smartphones, along 
with robust secondary smartphone markets, are rapidly lowering costs. Service costs, however, remain an issue. High 
service costs (for example, a data package for a mobile phone, a monthly Wi-Fi subscription, or access to a fixed line) 
drive overall costs for many consumers beyond the 5 percent threshold, presenting a significant barrier to affordability for 
poor and lower income populations in many countries.16 
Affordability could potentially be addressed through a number of complementary pathways, including increasing consumer 
incomes; increasing competition among Internet service providers; lowering taxes, fees, and regulatory hurdles for 
companies and consumers; government subsidies for private sector investment (e.g., Universal Service Funds); improved 
infrastructure buildout (including adjacent infrastructure such as roads and electricity); and innovative products or business 
models that drive down the costs of devices and services.  
User Capabilities  
To access the Internet, users must have the ability to use digital services. Learning to use a computer and mouse requires 
a full new set of skills, as does understanding how to navigate icons on a phone. In addition, general literacy is a 
fundamental skill for the full use of digital services and often a pre-cursor to digital literacy. Low literacy and numeracy 
rates17 impact the ability of consumers to use devices and access the Internet. In fact, recent surveys on the African 
continent cited lack of knowledge of how to use the Internet as the most significant reason for low usage.18  
Both education generally, and digital literacy courses specifically, can address this barrier. Intentional site and device 
design can also improve a user’s experience, making it simpler for new or inexperienced users to navigate online. In 
addition, as voice- and video-based and visual interfaces proliferate, this may become less of a barrier over time. However, 
poor literacy—and poor digital literacy in particular—remains a key barrier to Internet use today. 
Incentives  
Related to User Capability is the question of whether users want or see a need to get online. Given that 2.5 billion of the 4 
billion people not currently using the Internet live within the range of 3G networks,19 it can be inferred that demand-side 
issues, such as incentives, play a major role in Internet access, in addition to considerations of affordability and user 
capabilities. There are three primary aspects to the question of user “appetite”: awareness, relevant content, and social 
and cultural acceptance. For example, a Research ICT Africa study found that survey respondents’ primary reason for not 
using the Internet was that they did not know what it was.20 Language is also a key impediment in designing and providing 
local content that will appeal—and be accessible—to a larger range of consumers. Currently 80 percent of online content 
                                                          
14 Though Ark Invest estimates that the cost of Internet access through Google Loon infrastructure could be as low as $4 per month, Google 
Loon is currently in its pilot stage. The same article estimates that satellites could provide Internet access at a cost of $18 per month, which is 
too pricey for many low-income consumers (Keeney, 2015).

is available in only 10 languages, which only around 3 billion people speak as their first language.21 Finally, part of users’ 
interest (and ability) to get online stems from whether Internet use is seen to be socially or culturally acceptable. For 
example, gender and cultural barriers can impede the ability of women and other marginalized populations to access 
devices and the Internet. In a recent survey in Kenya on attitudes toward the Internet, respondents named a number of 
challenges that they felt Internet use might create, such as immorality, corruption, and time wastage.22 Gender barriers are 
also well documented, with women being up to 50 percent less likely to be online than men.23  
As more users create content and interact on sites and platforms such as WhatsApp, Wikipedia, Facebook, and YouTube, 
this type of user generation may serve to alleviate the language barrier, and bring more content online that is both 
interesting and appropriate for a variety of cultures (though currently 85 percent of the user-generated content indexed by 
Google comes from the United States, Canada, and Europe).24 In addition, the development of online products, such as 
digital financial services (DFS), and online health applications, can create incentives for users to access the Internet. 
Cross-Cutting Themes 
Finally, it is important to note that the four categories of barriers above are interconnected and complex. As discussed, 
addressing the challenge of infrastructure availability has direct implications for affordability, and increased awareness and 
demand for Internet services may incentivize providers (and national governments) to invest in infrastructure, relevant local 
content, and context-appropriate business models. Therefore, these barriers should not be addressed in isolation. Effective 
solutions should take an ecosystem approach, involving diverse actors and approaches, recognizing the “big picture,” and 
changing and adapting as that picture continues to evolve. 
UNDERSTANDING CURRENT PLAYERS AND EFFORTS TO INCREASE ACCESS  
Primary Roles in the Access Ecosystem 
A wide range of organizations and initiatives are working to address these barriers to access. SSG’s analysis suggests that 
most contribute in one of seven principal ways. 
Leveraging Networks and Convening and Hosting Discussions 
Owing partly to the fact that stakeholders within the access landscape come from private sector, civil society, and 
government institutions, communication and coordination between actors is not always smooth or consistent. For this 
reason, convening stakeholders is often a critical tool for encouraging communication across sectors and coordinating 
efforts across barriers. Some players work explicitly to organize and convene, hosting discussions to share ideas and 
solutions, coordinate projects and action, and encourage new partnerships. “We have a lot of conveners: the ITU 
broadband commission, World Economic Forum, and Global Connect,” said one key government stakeholder. 
In addition, certain organizations, by virtue of their reach, resources, and/or reputation, have access to a wide variety of 
potential partners and collaborators. Large technology firms such as Microsoft, Google, and Facebook, for example, have 
a unique ability to partner with diverse industry and government stakeholders, and have a vested business interest in 
ensuring a robust digital ecosystem. These networks can be brought to bear to either spark meaningful cross-sector 
collaboration, or to lobby for greater participation from key sectors (such as industry or host-country governments).  
Providing Funding and Capital 
Sustainable and sufficient finance is a critical need across the barriers to access. This includes financing for infrastructure 
expansion, technology development and deployment, and access projects and initiatives, as well as seed funding and 
investment in new and emerging business models for expanding access in developing countries. Financing access 
requires investment and participation from a range of players, from multilateral development banks and donors to impact 
investors and companies. The need for capital is high. As one development stakeholder said, “We can improve on what 
we’ve been doing, come up with innovative ways to do it, but change is still primarily about getting more funding into this 
area, to take advantage of those initiatives.” Host country governments, meanwhile, play a critical role in financing

infrastructure, developing National Broadband Plans that set aside funds for access expansion, and establishing Universal 
Service Funds to subsidize industry efforts to enhance access in rural and underserved areas.  
Conducting Research and Establishing Thought Leadership 
Another vital role involves researching, publishing, and disseminating new ideas, and spearheading new methods for 
improving access. Organizations such as the GSM Association (GSMA) and the World Bank produce widely read studies 
and publications that help drive and inspire action in the access space. These organizations’ research includes indices and 
global progress reports tracking current realities in access across the globe, and particularly in developing country 
contexts. For example, the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development’s annual State of Broadband report 
explores access, affordability, and broadband infrastructure in over 160 economies, and the GSMA has profiled specific 
countries’ efforts in expanding access.25 Reports also investigate the barriers to access, including their root causes, such 
as those articles highlighted in the key barriers section of this report (see Table 1, above). Other research explores and 
refines best practices for addressing the barriers to access. For example, WEF’s 2016 Internet for All report presented best 
practices to facilitate the development of replicable models for public–private collaboration. 
Universities and research organizations also provide valuable insights, whether as part of larger alliances—such as 
Columbia University’s role in the Connect to Learn initiative, where it leads research on ICT use within education—or 
independently. Research ICT Africa, for example, focuses on collecting data to inform ICT policy and regulations.  
Driving Advocacy 
Advocacy is an important tool, especially for raising the profile of the access challenge on the global agenda, pushing for 
greater host-country involvement and funding, and encouraging the adoption of more favorable regulatory, tax, and policy 
regimes to encourage private sector investment and to lower costs for consumers. “Governments often ask, ‘Why should I 
be first?’” said one member of an advocacy organization, “There is little confidence on their part with regards to the 
benefits of Internet access,” and this is one area that advocacy helps to address. This role addresses multiple barriers, 
since policy and regulatory change are a key aspects of both the Infrastructure and Affordability challenges. 
Industry groups, such as the GSMA, ITU, the Dynamic Spectrum Alliance, and Commonwealth Telecommunications 
Organization (CTO), and cross-sector coalitions, such as the Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) and the World Wide 
Web Foundation, are advocating directly for policy reform by working with and lobbying host country governments to 
develop more favorable policies, tax structures, and regulations, to ease policy and regulatory barriers to access. Others 
are advocating for particular approaches to addressing the barriers to access. For example, the People-Centered Internet 
initiative advocates for a universal, open, and affordable Internet. Organizations such as UNESCO and ITU’s Broadband 
Commission for Sustainable Development play a more indirect advocacy role by creating best practices, research, and 
action agendas that advocate for certain platforms, such as the development of broadband infrastructure. 
Developing and Deploying Technology Solutions 
Access is by no means a static field. Newer and faster means of sharing information and extending access are constantly 
being developed. Technology companies such as Google and Facebook are innovating around new ways to expand 
coverage, through hot-air balloons, satellites, and high-altitude drones, while device manufacturers such as Ericsson and 
Huawei are developing improved and lower-cost devices for emerging markets.  
Meanwhile, the continued deployment and expansion of established technologies and infrastructure (including both 
expanding coverage, and increasing speed and efficiencies, for example through deploying new localized server farms 
across the African continent) are also essential for increased access. Many development finance institutions (DFIs) are 
investing in established telecoms, which, with additional resources, can build out new towers to increase their reach, or 
upgrade networks from 2G to 3G or 4G. As one expert noted, “Broadband rollout is a scale activity: it can only be done 
really efficiently at scale. You might find different technology solutions, depending on population and other factors, but at 
the end of the day, it’s like any other infrastructure delivery.” Existing technologies can also be reimagined to address 
access gaps, including new ways of using TV White Space, localized mesh networks, and edge computing.

Smart deployment of technology addresses all four key barriers to access: it can lower costs for consumers and 
companies, and provide new platforms and content, which increases the Internet’s appeal for new users and draw 
additional people online. 
Incubating and Scaling Innovative Business Models 
Although the existing mobile operator-dominated paradigm has been phenomenally successful in bringing billions of 
people online, it does not appear poised to offer universal access.26 Alternative or complementary business models that 
serve low-income and rural customers are starting to emerge, including those championed by companies such as AirJaldi 
in India, Mawingu in Kenya, and Ericsson’s Managed Rural Coverage in sub-Saharan Africa. “Business models aren’t cut-
and-paste where you can take it from Sweden and put it to Botswana,” said one DFI stakeholder. “There are challenges 
that are unique to developing countries that aren’t necessarily there in developed countries.” 
Many of these new business models directly address the affordability barrier, by reducing costs for consumers and 
companies. Others serve to make new infrastructure deployment more affordable. For example, the growth in the last 10 
years of tower companies that capitalize on sharing network infrastructure in markets such as India and Myanmar has 
allowed established telecoms to defray their costs, increasing their reach and return on investment, and thus potentially 
lowering costs for the end-user as well. Innovative models around infrastructure buildout—including public-private 
partnerships to lay cable, such as the cable management organization that Bridgespan Ventures has brokered in the 
Gambia27—can support buildout for expanded access. Creative approaches to content, such as Over-the-Top services and 
Zero-Rated data, can also create solutions for affordability for users. Mobile network operators have promoted initiatives 
such as Econet Zero, which offers free access to over 50 websites through its services in Zimbabwe and Lesotho; 
technology companies are also working in this space, including Facebook’s Free Basics. 
The success of these business models requires more than a promising initial concept. Emerging models must be piloted; 
they require seed funding and finance for scale; they will need tailored incubator and accelerator services; and the lessons 
learned from both successes and failures must be effectively analyzed, understood, and shared.  
Building Capacity  
Building capacity involves developing the ability of individuals and organizations to both take advantage of the Internet and 
related services, and more effectively act to tackle the barriers to access. Addressing demand-side barriers such as 
incentives and user capabilities, it might relate to improving digital literacy for target users in emerging markets, such as 
what Intel’s She Will Connect initiative works to accomplish. Or, on the supply side, building capacity might entail helping 
organizations or governments better understand their political economy, infrastructure, and other needs and relevant policy 
options, and empowering them with the skills to design and implement interventions to address those needs. For instance, 
the Inter-American Development Bank is supporting governments in planning for infrastructure deployment, and 
developing National Broadband Plans or policies around Universal Service Funds (USFs), spectrum management, and 
open access conditions. USAID’s Global Broadband and Innovations program is similarly supporting host country 
governments in designing and implementing National Broadband Plans and in increasing the effective implementation of 
USFs. As one DFI stakeholder explained, “Much of what is needed in the telco space is not so much lending and 
investment, but advice.” 
Gaps in the Global Response 
SSG’s review suggests that, despite the diverse commitments to increased access from global development partners, 
significant gaps remain. To uncover these gaps, SSG mapped 60 initiatives across over 50 organizations—including non-
profits, foundations, industry, private finance, DFIs, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), research institutions, and 
government-led institutions28—to the roles they play and the barriers they seek to address. Many organizations work to

28 Please refer to Annex 3 to see a condensed version of this mapping for 19 key organizations. Though there are myriad organizations working 
to address different aspects of access, this mapping focused on a representative sampling of larger organizations. With new projects stepping 
into the space on an almost daily basis, a full landscape map of every project and organization was not feasible within the confines of this 
analysis. Further, it should be noted that information on different initiatives’ current activities and future plans is not always readily accessible; 
SSG worked with information currently available online or through the existing literature, and supplemented where possible through interviews 
with key stakeholders.

address more than one barrier, and they may do so by playing a number of different roles. However, SSG’s analysis 
sought to organize each organization or initiative by their fundamental focus barrier(s) and primary role(s).29  
SSG scored each initiative based on its intensity and sufficiency. Intensity—a measure of effort—took into account an 
intervention’s resourcing, geographic scope, degree of likely traction, and potential impact. For example, through 
interviews with key stakeholders, it became clear that DFID’s Emerging Policy Innovation and Capability (EPIC) Innovation 
Hub, while focused on supporting new business models for access, is in the process of reassessing its strategy, and 
therefore currently has few distinct projects. Consequently, it has a much lower intensity ranking than the Connect to Learn 
initiative (founded by Ericsson, Millennium Promise, and Columbia University’s Earth Institute), which has educated over 
76,000 students across 22 countries, while engaging 16 mobile operators. Intensity of effort, however, is only one part of 
the equation. Not every intervention has the same overall criticality; some roles are more or less appropriate to address 
different barriers, and different interventions may require different levels of effort to succeed. We, therefore, considered 
Sufficiency, which serves as a measure of the level of need. For example, although there is a high intensity of effort for 
providing funding for infrastructure development, it still requires billions of additional dollars in funding and investment. 
Meanwhile, it may require comparatively little in terms of thought leadership, for instance. 
By exploring the relationship between these two factors—defined as a ratio of intensity (level of current effort) to 
sufficiency (level of need)—this analysis identified 14 gaps in interventions (see Table 2 below). These gaps overlapped 
to a fair degree, so SSG further consolidated these into six key gaps in the access landscape.

Gap #1: Operationalizing Global Agendas 
Although there are many efforts underway to coordinate approaches and strategies, (including those by the State 
Department’s Global Connect Initiative, and the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organization’s Universal Broadband 
and Regulation initiative,) these efforts often take place primarily at a high level and have not been effectively 
operationalized both within the development community and beyond. One development professional questioned, “What 
                                                          
29 Initiatives often addressed multiple barriers using a variety of roles; the landscape map captures these distinctions. For example, the 
Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, an initiative of UNESCO and the ITU, was established to advocate for development of 
broadband infrastructure and focus on the SDGs, so it clearly drives advocacy. It also produces yearly reports on the state of broadband, 
however, contributing to research and thought leadership. Therefore, this initiative was tagged under both Driving Advocacy and Conducting 
Research. Since the initiative looks to bring a focus on the SDGs, it is also tagged as a cross-cutting initiative.

happens after convening? It needs to be operationalized.” A director at a global technology company added, “We all know 
the problem and what generally needs to be done; it is a question of how. The challenge is getting beyond superficiality.” 
Another technology company executive noted that, at current convenings, he always asks, “What is the outcome?” and 
rarely gets an answer. “It would be better to make the convenings smaller or more focused,” he suggested. Other 
interviewees agreed that there is considerably more to be done, particularly with host country governments, donor 
organizations, DFIs, MDBs, and others to actually operationalize best practices on the ground. 
Gap #2: Researching and Promoting Innovative Business Models  
Current efforts are under way to identify and support emerging business models for access. However, despite promising 
existing efforts, more is still needed to support and elevate new business models at the required scale, particularly for 
those regions where traditional business models begin to fail. As the CEO of a global organization noted, “different models 
for connectivity and services, supporting local capacity and experimentation, are really important. There are lots of good 
organizations in the global South around ICT, but they’re not getting resources to more rigorously test and share their 
ideas.” Though able to address cross-cutting barriers, these models are particularly important for addressing affordability, 
lowering costs through approaches that include freemium, advertiser-subsidized, and loss-leader models for lowering (or 
even eliminating) the cost of data for end users, network-extension models using low-cost technologies such as Wi-Fi, and 
global Over the Top service-mobile network operators (MNO) partnerships that provide access. 
Gap #3: Defining Success through Data and Thought Leadership  
Although many organizations publish valuable thought leadership pieces on Internet connectivity, there is a lack of reliable, 
comparable data from implementation efforts to help the practitioner community determine relative effectiveness, return on 
investment, and the distinctions between the types and qualities of access. In particular, a more nuanced understanding of 
the types and value of Internet use is necessary. Currently, much of the discussion and activity around understanding 
Internet use is limited to a binary framing of “Internet access” and “no Internet access.” As the executive director of one 
organization focused on expanding connectivity  explained, “Infrastructure, investment, and network planning on the 
ground is only one part of the equation; there is a need for an engagement-link to the user as well.” Understanding and 
tracking how people can engage with the Internet to benefit broader development goals is critical to making the argument 
for access to be integrated across these goals. 
For example, through its Web Index, the World Wide Web Foundation tries to track the extent to which ICTs are actually 
being deployed to improve education, health, agriculture, and disaster risk reduction in poor communities, but often 
discovers that the data are difficult to find. “There are only pilot projects, and no systematic approach,” said one 
stakeholder. Better data creating that linkage could help to make the case for more focused attention. As a lead specialist 
for a DFI explained, “There are use cases, but economic modelling is the next step. There is quite a void right now in terms 
of this analysis.” Backed by better information on the linkages between access and other development goals, a shared 
understanding of what constitutes “meaningful use” will help to drive and clarify disparate efforts in the access ecosystem, 
addressing cross-cutting barriers.30 
Gap #4: Generating and Curating Best Practices and Toolkits 
A number of organizations and initiatives focus on convening discussions around best practices or setting global agendas 
to address access as a whole. The gaps in this role relate to the need for additional research, particularly around best 
practices for infrastructure, affordability, and user capabilities. Specifically, SSG’s analysis showed a need for key 
stakeholders (such as the GSMA), in conjunction with universities and other research institutions, to work together to 
develop landscape assessments and collect data to generate, showcase, and curate best practices in these areas, and to 
create associated toolkits to streamline implementation accordingly. One researcher suggested, “Maybe there are already 
many capacity-building organizations and research organizations, but there is space for an new actor to coordinate these 
efforts, or to support grassroots organizations that are already in place, and perhaps are in direct contact with policy-
makers.” 
                                                          
30 DIAL, Caribou Digital, and other sector leaders have played a leading role in promoting a more nuanced definition of meaningful use of the 
internet. 
 17 
 
Gap #5: Researching and Developing New Technologies  
The access landscape is ever-changing, with the emergence of new, breakthrough technologies and new methods for 
using existing resources to address the barriers to access. Although a number of groups, including those within Google, 
Facebook, Ericsson, and Huawei, are innovating and deploying new and refashioned technology solutions, SSG’s gap 
analysis clearly showed that more research and development would be beneficial in several specific areas, including 
technology solutions for extending infrastructure (for example, continuing Facebook’s Aquila beyond the pilot stage, or 
developing Google’s Loon to the point to which it can be cost competitive with fiber cables). Ongoing research into 
methods for decreasing technology costs (both in terms of infrastructure and devices) is also necessary, and new user 
interfaces that are more intuitive and do not rely on written text will help address incentive and capability barriers. 
Gap #6: Funding Activities Across the Barriers to Access 
Although the investments by the multilateral development banks (MDBs) and other DFIs are significant, they are often 
directed to more commercially viable opportunities targeting urban and middle-class market segments. “Financing gaps 
exist for smaller more startup oriented businesses with an idea in the pilot stage,” noted one finance director. A small but 
growing number of impact investors such as CRE Ventures and Vulcan are providing critical financing to early-stage 
access-related businesses in developing countries, and other organizations are providing grants at a much smaller scale 
as key financing under broader initiatives, such as Microsoft’s Affordable Access Initiative. However, the need in this area 
remains high. As a key representative from USAID pointed out in an interview, “In order to take advantage of those 
initiatives, we need to be turning them into budget.” Additional financing, therefore, would aid in a number of areas, 
including large-scale infrastructure deployments, supporting trainings and building capacity, scaling and supporting cross-
cutting initiatives, kick starting and growing new business models, and R&D into new technologies, both for infrastructure 
development, and devices and services. 
These six gaps represent both a challenge and opportunity to those seeking to advance universal access. Although these 
gaps are significant and represent a major shortfall in the global response, they also highlight areas for cooperation and 
collaboration across host governments, the development community, industry, and civil society. There are opportunities for 
actors from each sector to make meaningful and even catalytic contributions toward the broader goal of universal access 
to aid overall development objectives. 
ADVANCING ACCESS: OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLECTIVE ACTION  
Through an assessment of the current actors, barriers, and roles, this analysis has highlighted that critical gaps remain. 
Taken as a whole these gaps may seem daunting, but three clear recommendations emerged that would allow the 
international development actors to take advantage of their respective capabilities and tools in their work to achieve 
universal access. They therefore present major opportunities for collective action across governments, development 
organizations, industry, and civil society. 
 
Recommendation #1: Mainstream Access Across the Development Agenda

concrete, on-the-ground results. Even successful global initiatives have struggled to generate follow-through within both 
development organizations and host-country governments. Here, development agencies, with their large stocks of patient 
capital, have a significant role to play in providing the funding, expertise, and advocacy needed to push universal access 
as a mainstream component across the development agenda 
Actions for Impact 
 Conduct outreach to key stakeholders in the access community to collectively create a case for more investment in 
and measurement of the economic benefits of access programs at the regional and sectoral levels. 
 Work with key donor organizations on internal communications strategies to ensure that access is well understood 
by sectoral program managers. 
 Develop training frameworks and toolkits that can be used by development agencies to build the capacity of staff 
and host country partners on how to integrate access into program design across development sectors. 
 Work with leaders at bilateral development organizations to advocate for legislative bodies to support access goals 
(similar to HR 5537 and the recent Executive Order, or EO). 
 Work with an academic partner to develop a curriculum for mid-level government ministry officials to help them 
more effectively present their needs for infrastructure development, tax policy changes, and other regulatory 
reforms to those with the power to implement these changes. 
 
By leveraging the global calls to action, development organizations have the opportunity to both amplify these high-level 
mandates and, more importantly, provide the means for translating those calls into results on the ground where it matters.  
 
Build an Economic Impact Model 
There is a need to to enable host government policymakers and civil

social outcomes. Initially this model would use publicly available data in 
- Lead ICT researcher a few pilot countries and predictive analytics to judge the long-term 
outcomes of access programs that are being deployed today, or will be 
deployed in the future.  
Actions for Impact 
 Conduct a thorough assessment of the leading indicators that could help measure economic growth over time, 
including improved employment rates, development and use of e-government services, improved health care 
delivery, decreased mortality rates, increased access to education (particularly by girls), increased numbers of new 
businesses, and  improved access to new sectors. 
 Assess what similar tools exist or have been developed, even in single countries or as pilots in certain sectors, to 
determine successes and challenges with those tools. 
 Partner with a firm specializing in data and analytics to determine the best way to collect, aggregate, and display 
information, including the development of an online interface to allow access to data, or to allow governments to 
customize data. 
 Promote pilot projects for the tool at both the national and regional levels in four to six key developing markets to 
track how investments in access can help develop a more holistic digital ecosystem. 
 Develop a plan to scale to further countries in the next five years. 
 Use the data and analysis from this tool to publish frequent reports, thought pieces, and other collateral to drive

attention toward the benefits of increased access. 
 
Such a tool could serve another important purpose: although a limited number of MDBs, DFIs, and private investors are 
providing direct capital and funding to support expanded access, the Economic Impact Model could provide useful 
information that encourages a greater number of private and public investors to commit resources toward access, to 
secure both economic and societal returns. There is also an opportunity for a global organization to play a critical 
supporting role, encouraging, directing and helping to mobilize further investment and capital for improved access.  
Developing and promulgating an Economic Impact Model can support the case for continued and sustained public sector 
investments in access initiatives from within host countries and with support from the MDBs. 
 
 
 
Recommendation #2: Amplify Innovative Business Models 
In the first report in the Connecting the Last Billion series, SGG highlighted innovative business models that can help 
deliver access to populations not traditionally reached by the major MNOs. However, these models and enterprises face 
major challenges, including a lack of early-stage financing, limited partnership opportunities, and unfamiliar or restrictive 
regulations. Some organizations, including Microsoft, have directly

financed individual companies with such business models, but 
Operationalizing Global Agendas  these efforts have largely been ad hoc. There is a need for greater 
leadership in this area by creating an actionable strategy to not

coordinated strategy, there is a risk that donors and investors will

and persistence with the ability to truly scale.  
Funding Activities Across the Barriers to Access 
 
Actions for Impact 
 Establish a working group with key partners from development organizations, the private sector, and other key 
initiatives to ensure coordination of efforts, funding, and research (groups would include Microsoft, Google, 
Facebook, Vulcan, USAID, Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), DFID, Millennium 
Challenge Corporation (MCC), and WEF). 
 Leverage the working group to conduct research on disruptive models for affordability in different markets. 
 Develop a blended financing model/mechanism for supporting innovative access business models as they move 
from start-up, to early-stage, to minimum viable product, to revenue growth and scaling. 
 Work with existing incubators/social impact innovators to scale the mechanism over time through their networks. 
 Create opportunities to promote enterprises that are successfully deploying and scaling new business models, 
especially at key global convenings such as United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), WEF, Mobile World 
Congress, and others. 
 
By developing strategies to identify, incubate, accelerate, and scale innovative business models,developing and promoting 
case studies of successful and profitable business models that can be replicated in new markets, and researching 
emergent models, actors would be promoting opportunities to expand access to those who would otherwise risk being left 
with none.

Recommendation #3: Develop Consistency in Approaches to Digital Access 
SSG’s analysis found that, despite the large number of

about what does and does not work across the different barriers

develop more targeted and more effective access programs. 
Actions for Impact 
 Hold in-depth conversations with stakeholders to better understand their key learnings, what tools are currently in 
place, including where they are being used and how they are being used, and where there may be gaps in broad 
understanding. Initial areas of exploration could include: 
o Affordable devices and services 
o Infrastructure development 
o The size of the digital literacy challenge, and options for addressing it 
o The most effective trainings and building capacity methodologies for teaching digital skills 
o Addressing cultural and gender barriers 
 Collect case studies, toolkits, and other materials from key organizations to analyze their effectiveness, and 
consolidate them into a suite of resources that can be shared across a broader spectrum of partners and markets. 
 Partner with one or more universities (examples include Columbia, Harvard, Tufts, Johns Hopkins, University of 
Washington, Berkeley, and Stanford) to develop online courses that help organizational leaders and entrepreneurs 
better understand how to address key barriers to access. 
 Refine and edit materials for consistency, with a focus on well-defined audiences (for example, policymakers, 
entrepreneurs, or development professionals). 
 Build a database of case studies that show how successful models work in a variety of geographies and across 
countries with different levels of willingness or ability to engage in expanding access. 
 Develop an online property that will allow for easy curation and dissemination of best practices, including a self-
assessment tool for private sector players to determine their readiness to enter the space. 
 
CONCLUSION 
The global community is increasingly recognizing the importance of delivering Internet access to those who do not have it.  
Although there has been great progress over the last decade, less than half of the world’s population is able to access the 
Internet and, more troubling, growth in access is slowing rapidly across the developing world. In the past, this question of 
access has largely been the purview of industry, host government regulators, and infrastructure providers. As the social, 
economic and governance benefits of digitization become ever more obvious, however, the centrality of universal access 
to the development agenda is increasing. There is, therefore, ever greater focus on how to attain universal Internet access. 
With greater attention on access, higher levels of political will, and a host of organizations and governments incorporating 
access into their strategies, development organizations have an opportunity—now—to leverage their core capabilities to 
create meaningful impact with regard to achieving the goal of universal access. By working together across sectors, 
international actors have the chance to significantly accelerate access and enable the world’s poor, rural, and marginalized 
populations to play an important role in our increasingly digitally intermediated world.

ANNEXES 
Annex 1: Limitations of Analysis 
The research and analysis that informed this report were conducted from July through August 2016. The outcome is not 
intended to be a comprehensive or complete review of the access landscape. Rather, it is meant to inform and inspire 
global actors. There are several limitations to this analysis that should be noted: 
 Interviewees were selected to provide insight into key organizations in the access landscape. They represent civil 
society, industry, and the donor community. However, given the small sample size—23 interviews—and the relatively 
quick timeframe for conducting interviews, there is a bias reflected here toward those who were more responsive to 
interview requests (perhaps because they were familiar with either SSG or DIAL) and toward interviewees and 
organizations prioritized by the DIAL and SSG teams. 
 Further, it should be noted that information on different initiatives’ current activities and future plans is not always 
readily accessible; SSG worked with information currently available online or through the existing literature, and 
supplemented where possible through interviews with key stakeholders. For this reason, some information about 
current actors’ activities and future plans may be incomplete, outdated, or incorrect.  
 Finally, SSG acknowledges that its rankings of intensity and sufficiency are by and large subjective, though informed 
by SSG’s research and analysis over the course of this project.

The following Organizational Landscape Map reflects the activities of a range of key actors and initiatives in the access 
space, taken from a larger map that SSG used to conduct its analysis. This map is not exhaustive, however, and does not 
include all of the projects or relevant actors working on this issue today. Because this space is relatively new and ever 
changing, SSG opted to focus on a representative sampling of larger organizations.
