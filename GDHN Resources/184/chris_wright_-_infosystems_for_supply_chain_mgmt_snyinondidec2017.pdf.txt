UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF LMIS AND HMIS
• Health management information systems 
(HMIS) collect, aggregate and use service
data from health facilities
• Logistics management information systems 
(LMIS) collect and use medicines supply
data from health and storage facilities
DEFINING HMIS  
• A health management information system (HMIS) collects 
and reports program information, such as incidence of disease, 
client/patient information, and health services rendered. HMIS 
data can be used to determine disease patterns or to track 
health services use, as well as to monitor and evaluate health 
service delivery. 
• DHIS2 is the most widely used application 
in LMICs, an is optimized for data reporting.

DEFINING LMIS
• A logistics management information system (LMIS) is an 
information system that is used to collect, organize, and present 
logistics data gathered from all levels of the health system. An 
LMIS enables logisticians to collect the data needed to make 
informed decisions that will ultimately improve product 
availability and customer service. One immediate decision that 
is made based on logistics data is the quantities of products that 
should be resupplied to health facilities.
• OpenLMIS, Logistimo, and Real Time Value NetworkTM
are examples of LMIS applications in use in Africa and Asia; 
they are optimized for supply chain management

Linking LMIS and HMIS Data for Improved Use of Information
• Intervention: General restructuring of the facility-based
Routine Health Information Systems
• Before the improved RHIS, vaccine stockouts went unreported
• After linking LMIS and HMIS, vaccine stockouts could be monitored
monthly, and the relationship between stockouts and children
vaccinated could be tracked
• Evidence of an elevated stockout percentage alerted MOH
to request additional vaccines from donors
