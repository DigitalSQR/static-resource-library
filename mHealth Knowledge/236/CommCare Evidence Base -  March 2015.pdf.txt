Critical Properties for Frontline 
Worker (FLW) Applications 
There are three critical properties of successful 
mobile applications for FLWs (Figure 1).  
Client Tracking allows FLWs to register and track 
clients over time. A client list is maintained on the 
phone as a longitudinal record for each client. This 
means that a client such as a pregnant mother can 
be registered and followed up with multiple times. 
Client tracking is an important feature for FLWs to 
conduct visits that requires complex workflows. 
Decision Support is used by FLWs to improve the 
quality of home visits through electronic checklists, Figure 1. The three critical properties of CommCare and

The Four Pillars of Evidence 
The CommCare Evidence Base is organized into 
four pillars. Each is based on how CommCare 
influences clients’ knowledge, attitude, and 
practices (Figure 4).  
Before anything, the evidence base looks at FLWs’ 
and clients’ perceived Acceptability and 
Feasibility of CommCare.  This refers to whether 
CommCare is well received by FLWs and clients 
across geographical regions and types of 
programs. Barriers to this include that CommCare 
is too difficult to use, not intuitive, or that FLWs or 
clients are skeptical or hesitant to use CommCare. Figure 4. The four pillars of the CommCare Evidence Base. 
Before any other evidence can be established, it is 
important to demonstrate that CommCare is well persuasive. Common barriers to high experience of

Findings 
Although there is no definitive study showing an 
improvement in health outcomes from adopting 
CommCare, the collective evidence base suggests 
that, when used correctly, CommCare’s system 
can improve community programs, both in the 
health and non-health domains.

CommCare improves monitoring and 
communication. In one project in India, the 
introduction of CommCare improved data 
completeness from 67% with the paper-based 
system to an average of 84% with CommCare.
