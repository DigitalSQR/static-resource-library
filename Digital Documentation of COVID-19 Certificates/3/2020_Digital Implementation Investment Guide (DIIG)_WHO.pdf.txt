Foreword 
The transformative nature of digital technologies for health is undeniable. Today, over 
half of the world’s population have access to a mobile phone. Increasing access to 
mobile technologies has radically changed the way in which people may manage their 
own health, as well as the way in which health services are delivered. Health systems 
recognize that digital health technologies are critical for accelerating progress towards the 
achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Greater investment, however, will be 
needed to elevate the role of digital health in health systems, so that the positive impact 
on health of individuals and populations can be fully realized. 
The large-scale digital transformation of a health system is neither a quick nor a simple task. Rapid advancements in 
digital technologies have made it easier to build individual technologies than to invest in and implement them such 
that they function in a harmonized and complementary manner. Long-term systemic changes are needed, including a 
change in the culture of using data. Investment must be carefully and thoughtfully coordinated for equitable access to 
meet the full spectrum of health needs. 
At the Seventy-First World Health Assembly, WHO’s Member States requested WHO not only to develop a global 
strategy on digital health, but also to provide guidance for scaling up the implementation of digital health in line with 
WHO’s Thirteenth General Programme of Work. In 2019, WHO launched the first WHO Guideline Recommendations on 
Digital Interventions for Health System Strengthening to ensure that Member States use of digital health is informed by 
the evidence for “what works”. This Digital implementation investment guide (DIIG): integrating digital interventions into 
health programmes provides guidance on how to practically invest in and implement the recommendations outlined in 
the WHO guideline according to national contexts, health sector needs and state of digital maturity. Investment must 
be both effective and sustainable, with clearly anticipated health benefits for all.
Digital technologies are improving rapidly. Building a digital foundation that can be responsive to the diversity of 
programme needs, but which also anticipates innovation is key. Under the framework of the emerging Global Strategy 
on Digital Health, WHO, HRP, UNICEF, UNFPA, and PATH have developed the DIIG document to provide guidance on 
investing in programmatic implementations for digital transformations of health systems in a systematic manner. Such 
strategic investments allow for long-term sustainability on a national scale. Informed by experience across multiple 
regions and agencies, the DIIG provides practical methods for approaching needs assessment, planning, investment 
and implementation of digital health systems. 
The lure of exciting new technologies and gadgets is ever present, but ultimately these technologies should be 
promoting health, keeping the world safe, and serving the vulnerable. If implemented in a strategically harmonized 
manner, leveraging the key principles and messages presented in the DIIG, these digital health systems are powerful 
tools that will help us achieve the ultimate goal of health and well-being for all.

CHAPTER 
01 INTRODUCTION
This Digital Implementation Investment Guide (DIIG) aims to help governments 
and technical partners plan a digital health implementation that focuses on one 
or more health programmes to support national health system goals. 
 
The Guide is designed to walk users of the document step-by-step through 
planning, costing and implementing digital health interventions within a digital 
health enterprise. This consists of selecting digital health interventions that are 
aligned with identified health needs, appropriate to a specific country context 
and integrated with existing technologies and the broader digital architecture. 
Users of the Guide will learn from diverse experiences deploying digital health 
technologies over the past decade and will be guided through a systematic 
approach to designing, costing and implementing meaningful digital health 
interventions that are part of a digital health enterprise.
A digital health enterprise comprises the business processes, data, systems and technologies used to support 
the operations of the health system, including the point-of-service software applications, devices and  
hardware and the underlying information infrastructure (such as the digital health platform) that deliver health 
services accelerated and amplified by digital and data technologies. Digital health enterprise architectures 
have varying degrees of maturity and institutionalization within the broader ecosystem. This document 
makes a distinction between siloed digital health system architectures and exchanged digital health system 
architectures that contribute to a national digital health enterprise architecture. Siloed digital health system 
architectures are disconnected applications that aim to fulfil a project goal. These siloed digital health 
implementations are implemented in the context of a time-bound, stand-alone digital health project, usually 
to demonstrate proof of concept, findings from which may eventually contribute towards a government-
sponsored digital health implementation. 
Exchanged digital health system architectures, on the other hand, consist of multiple applications leveraging 
standards and connected through a health information exchange to address needs across various health 
programmes, operating in a coordinated manner within a national digital health enterprise architecture. 
Additionally, this Guide acknowledges the existence of siloed, integrated and ball-of-mud architectures 
and steers the user towards planning and investing in cumulative and modular enterprise digital health 
implementations that result in collective benefit across the health system. This Guide focuses on the 
implementation of exchanged digital health system architectures that are modular in nature and support one  
or more programmes across the health sector and, potentially, even beyond the health sector.

Introduction 3
1.1  The Guide’s role in planning and  
implementing a digital health enterprise
A fully realized digital health enterprise delivers health in the digital age. The implementation of a digital 
health enterprise includes the people who design, build, deploy and maintain the systems, accompanied by a 
governance framework, an enabling policy environment and an operational plan. The process of planning and 
implementing an appropriate digital health enterprise within the broader ecosystem includes several phases:
1. assessing the current state and enabling environment
2. establishing a shared understanding and strategic planning
3. defining the future state
4. planning enterprise architecture
5. determining health content requirements 
6. monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and fostering data use
7. implementing, maintaining and scaling.
Fig. 1.1.1 outlines these steps as well as supporting resources (referenced in Table 1.1.2) that will help you successfully 
navigate the process of planning and implementing an appropriate digital health enterprise. This Guide focuses 
primarily on defining the future state and highlights appropriate resources associated with the other phases. (See 
Box 1.1.3 for resources applied to specific use cases.)

1.2 How to use this Guide
This Guide covers the different phases outlined in Fig. 1.1.1 by leveraging supporting resources, focusing the most 
detail on phases 2–5. This document is designed to be used in two ways:
+ to support a facilitated planning process, resulting in a costed implementation plan suitable for a funder, whether 
a government finance ministry or an agency (such as the World Bank, Gavi, The Global Fund or Bill & Melinda Gates 
Foundation).
+ to provide stand-alone topical information and outputs, organized by chapter, for establishing and costing a digital 
health implementation.

PRINCIPLES FOR  
DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT
+ Understand how your work fits into the global development landscape. Identify 
others working on the same problem in other geographies and determine if there 
is a community of practice that relates to your work. Find the technical leaders 
through virtual networks or communities of practice, such as the Global Digital 
Health Network, the Asia eHealth Information Network (AeHIN), Global Digital 
Health Partnership, Digital Health and Interoperability Working Group, Health Data 
Collaborative, African Alliance for Digital Health and/or Implementing Best Practices 
Initiative, who can help you disseminate your work to other teams, regions and 
countries. 
 
3 + Engage diverse experts across disciplines, countries and industries throughout the BE COLLABORATIVE
project life cycle. Create an engagement plan to apply this expertise at all phases 
and incorporate insights through feedback loops. Look for tools and approaches from 
other sectors and publish your findings so that they are available to other groups and 
countries.
+ Plan to collaborate from the beginning. Build collaborative activities into proposals, 
work plans, budgets and job descriptions. Identify indicators for measuring 
collaboration in your M&E plan.

2.1  Determine roles and responsibilities
Before embarking on the full planning process, you should form your team. Consider what skills, functions 
and knowledge may help when crafting a comprehensive costed implementation plan for a funder. Seek out 
individuals with adequate dedicated time who are qualified, motivated and knowledgeable over three areas: 
governance, management and operations.

area Role Description
GOVERNANCE Digital health May include a sponsor from a senior ministry and representatives from other relevant 
governance ministries and funders, as well as technical team leaders. In some contexts, digital 
mechanisms health governance committees are called Technical Working Groups.
These governing stakeholders oversee the digital health investment’s progress, 
engage the right stakeholders, ensure financing and provide sufficient oversight to 
the Management and Operations teams. They set the overall direction, make key 
decisions and select important team members.
Digital health Accountable for successfully deploying the digital health intervention within 
lead the context of the broader health system and may be tasked with developing or 
refining the national digital health strategy. The digital health lead may also be 
responsible for identifying needed policies and gaps, such as in data security, 
standards and the national digital health enterprise architecture.
MANAGEMENT Project/process Takes on the responsibility for day-to-day direction of the implementation, 
manager communicates with the Governance team and ensures that the system is deployed 
on time and on budget. Ideally, an influential and skilled person within the MOH 
will fill this role, but technical partners can support it. The project manager should 
possess excellent managerial, technical and negotiation skills. This person also 
facilitates and promotes adoption of the change-management process.
Procurement Ensures that implementation partners follow organizational guidelines for 
manager contracting and licensing.
M&E analyst Reviews the planned digital health intervention to determine the key indicators 
to use for monitoring progress and ensuring that national needs for reporting 
indicators are met. In some contexts, this role may be called the data manager or 
health management information system (HMIS) lead. 
Digital health Ensures that the planned digital health implementation can operate within the 
specialist/ current ICT infrastructure, recommends new infrastructure investments and 
Enterprise reviews ICT human-resource capacity to ensure that the entire digital health 
architect enterprise can be deployed sustainably. This person should have expertise in 
informatics or HIS architecture.

conducted at country level, bolstered by specific examples from Canada, Estonia, Malaysia, Mali, Nigeria, Norway, 
the Philippines and Rwanda. 
The Digital health convergence meeting toolkit (43) provides useful considerations for establishing governance 
mechanisms through convergence meetings that bring together different stakeholders, including departments 
in MOHs, development partners, international NGOs, experts in related fields and end-users. The convergence-
meeting approach offers a framework for bringing together government officials from different ministries, 
digital health professionals in countries and technical experts committed to successfully implementing and 
strengthening the HIS and digital health.

of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) for informing prioritization of digital systems addressing national health 
priorities, in line with directives from the President’s Recovery Plan (40). This process sought to align the 
use of digital tools with defined health system challenges in response to the immediate national priorities 
of restoring health services, particularly related to malaria, acute malnutrition and maternal and newborn 
deaths due to home deliveries (40). Furthermore, the fragmented approach to digital health investments 
during the Ebola outbreak underscored the importance of governance structures and strategic planning.
During this process, WHO and the MOHS convened a diverse set of stakeholders representing programme 
directorates leading work across various health domains, information systems and M&E of aggregate health 
indicators, the Ministry of ICT, donors, NGOs and implementation partners (41). Over the course of a three-
day workshop, the convening organizations facilitated discussions on the specific health needs that would 
be the focus of digital health investments, as well as the governance structure for developing a national 
digital health enterprise architecture and administering digital health investments. 
This process resulted in defining 
the roles of different directorates 
within the MOHS and assigning We, the stakeholders here gathered, under the firm

BID INITIATIVE  
CASE STUDY 
BID Initiative: User advisory groups and goals
The BID Initiative was designed to be country led and country owned, with partnership and 
collaboration elevated as core values. In Tanzania, the Immunization and Vaccine Development 
program (a department of the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and 
Children) oversaw the overall governance of the BID Initiative, and a user advisory group (UAG) was 
established to play a critical role in the prioritization, design and development of proposed approaches 
and interventions (44). PATH and other technical partners provided management and operations 
support. The UAG met in person monthly, and each member served as a champion for BID, sharing 
information and gathering feedback in their local communities, as well as supporting dissemination 
and implementation of the completed interventions.
The UAG provided an opportunity for end-users » poor data visibility into supplies at the facility

2.2  Develop a common understanding of the  
health programme’s needs and goals 
Once you have formed the planning team, convene them and any necessary additional stakeholders to 
articulate a common understanding of the main goals of the health programme and how they align with 
your country’s national digital health strategy (if there is one). The team should also review core programme 
documents, data and assessment reports that describe the programme’s goals and objectives, including how it 
has performed to date.

2.3  Understand programme operations  
across levels of the health system 
All stakeholders need to understand how the current health programme operates in practice, including the 
workflows and information flows across all levels of the health system (a focus of Chapter 3). You may find it 
helpful to document the structure of the health system and the types of workers and their roles at each level of 
the system. Resources like organizational diagrams (organograms) and health workforce operational guidance 
may exist that describe the health programme’s management, human-resource structure and expected roles 
and responsibilities. 
During this step, try to describe the following: You may find it helpful to create a diagram using

3.1  Map the current state of programme activities
First, you will need to understand how the health programme currently functions, or the workflow of the 
programme. This requires thinking through the tasks that are performed to meet the goals and priorities of the 
health programme articulated in Chapter 2. In other words, you will analyse the various processes within the 
health programme and identify the bottlenecks that prevent optimal delivery of those services, resulting in a 
diagram of the current state. 
The process for mapping the current state has three steps.
1. Determine the health programme processes to target.
2. Map the user journey (illustrated through a workflow) within each of these processes.
3. Identify bottlenecks within each workflow.

BID INITIATIVE  
CASE STUDY 
BID Initiative: Business processes
It was hard for Oliver Mlemeta, the sister in charge at the Usa River Health Facility in Tanzania, to know how 
many children to expect on immunization day. To figure out which children were due, she would spend hours 
sifting through dense immunization registries and tallying numbers. Then she had to make sure she had 
adequate supplies on hand. If her vaccine stock was low, she would spend more time calling other clinics and 
retrieving what she needed by motorbike. Sometimes, she would have to turn mothers and children away 
because there were not enough supplies.
When her facility’s immunization day arrived, Oliver and her team would vaccinate hundreds of children. 
Afterwards, more days of reporting awaited the team; they often worked nights and weekends to record 
metrics into paper ledgers by hand. Once the data were sent to the district, it was just as difficult for district 
staff to provide feedback that could help Oliver improve services. She rarely knew how she and her facility 
were performing because the flow of data was often unidirectional.
The BID Initiative was designed to 
make Oliver’s work easier, to help her 
do her job better and to reach more

3.2  Conduct a root cause analysis of bottlenecks
A root cause analysis helps identify the factors underlying the bottlenecks occurring in health programme 
processes. This analysis narrows the list of actionable bottlenecks and determines which issues can be 
addressed with available resources. 
Three types of root causes may emerge through this may not be because the vaccines are out of stock, but

3.3  Prioritize bottlenecks
Now that you have a better understanding of their root causes, you can rank the bottlenecks, identifying those 
that contribute the most to preventing success of the health programme. Although you may ideally like to 
address every bottleneck, limits on resources often require focusing on the most important challenges or the 
ones that you feel you have the ability to influence. Stakeholders should discuss and review the bottlenecks and 
their root causes, comparing them until they agree on a ranking from most to least critical. 
Factors that influence bottleneck rankings include Table 3.3.1 offers some considerations for ranking 
whether the issue can actually be resolved, the capacity bottlenecks, which you may find useful in guiding 
of stakeholders to drive this change and the potential discussion and reaching consensus among stakeholders.

3.4  Map programme-specific bottlenecks to  
generic health system challenges
At this point, focus on describing the highest priority bottlenecks using a common vocabulary, so you can link 
them to possible interventions. WHO developed a classification for health system challenges that standardizes 
the categories of common bottlenecks experienced at various levels of the health system (see Fig. 3.4.1). 
This classification provides a consistent method for grouping the diverse ways that various participants, 
from patients to health workers to decision-makers, have for expressing very granular, programme-specific 
bottlenecks and their root causes. It also ensures that all stakeholders have a common understanding of the 
challenges and a consistent language for articulating the need, as well as for mobilizing support and funding.

Box 3.4.2.  Linking health system challenges to universal health coverage.
Although you have gone through an extensive process to identify the key bottlenecks and health system 
challenges, you may have overlooked some areas. You may want to take the further step of mapping your 
bottlenecks to the different contributors to achieving universal health coverage (UHC). The goals of UHC aim to 
ensure access to all individuals who need services and that these services are delivered with the intended quality 
and do not cause financial hardship (55). 
The Tanahashi framework is a common approach to articulating the set of health system challenges that need to 
be overcome in efforts to achieve UHC for specific health interventions within target populations (see Fig. 3.4.3). 
Reviewing the different sections of the framework, such as supply and demand, can also highlight the range 
of different health system challenges that should be addressed. For example, it may be difficult to overcome 
the challenge of loss to follow-up of clients (continuous coverage) if there is low demand for services (contact 
coverage) and clients are not coming to facilities in the first place. The updated framework used here includes the 
following layers (56):
» ACCOUNTABILITY COVERAGE: the proportion of those in the target population known and registered in 
the health system
» ACCESSIBILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES: includes ensuring availability of commodities, 
equipment and human resources and accessibility to health facilities
» CONTACT COVERAGE: proportion of clients who have contact with relevant facilities, health workers and 
services among the target population
» CONTINUOUS COVERAGE: the extent to which clients receive the full course of intervention required to 
be effective 
» EFFECTIVE COVERAGE: the proportion of individuals receiving satisfactory health services among the 
target population
» FINANCIAL COVERAGE: the proportion of patients protected from impoverishment due to health-related 
costs.
Annex 3.2 provides a template for mapping bottlenecks to health system challenges and examples of bottlenecks 
linked to health-system-challenge classifications by UHC layer.

In the previous chapter, you examined different health programme processes and identified key health system 
challenges. In this chapter, you will rethink the way these tasks are performed and reflect on interventions to 
address the identified bottlenecks (see Fig. 4.1). This is called business process redesign. It is at this stage where 
you will critically assess whether and how digital health applications may be used to alleviate the identified 
bottlenecks. Then, based on your decision, you can begin to describe what digital health applications must do to 
effectively support the optimized health programme processes.

4.1  Determine and select digital health interventions 
for the prioritized health system challenges
Over the past two decades, a variety of digital health approaches have been tested as ways of alleviating health 
system challenges that have not otherwise been adequately addressed. From health-promotion messages sent 
to clients to applications that track stock levels, digital health interventions have been used individually (siloed) 
or combined with shared services using data exchange standards to form robust and extensible digital health 
enterprises.

CASE STUDY
Determining appropriateness of digital health interventions  
for health system challenges 
As part of the joint process with the Ministry of Health and Sanitation in Sierra Leone for identifying 
health system challenges and assessing the appropriateness of digital health interventions, WHO 
convened stakeholders to review challenges faced within the health system and across different 
programmatic areas. This was a consultative process to identify areas of improvement and assess 
whether digital health interventions may play a role in addressing some of the issues that were raised. 
Table 4.1.4 gives some examples of bottlenecks raised during this multistakeholder assembly, as well as 
discussions about the role of digital health interventions in addressing the root causes of these health 
system challenges.

4.2 Determine whether the enabling  
environment can support the identified  
digital health interventions 
Digital health interventions are delivered through digital health applications, which ideally are linked to a 
supportive digital health platform comprising shared services and enabling components (in cases where 
there are multiple applications); together with the people, processes and policies that support and use them 
to deliver health services to clients, these applications and platform make up the digital health enterprise. 
Successful deployment of digital health applications requires a thorough knowledge of the ecosystem where 
the interventions will be deployed and whether they can be supported in that environment. Understanding this 
context can inform the feasibility of implementing the digital health enterprise, as well as demonstrate where 
system integrations will be required. 
For example, in settings with limited infrastructure and A comprehensive digital health strategy establishes the

4.4  Determine if existing digital health  
applications, platforms and enterprises  
can achieve the requirements
A digital health intervention operates through a digital health application, which when connected to other 
shared technologies (such as data-exchange enabling components and registries in the platform), together 
with the supported business processes, policies that govern them and people that use them, make up a digital 
health enterprise. The best scenario is that your digital health investment leverages or extends the digital health 
enterprise that is already in place in your context. Building on existing investments, such as by expanding the 
functionality of existing applications or the connected platforms (like shared services) or incorporating new 
health content into the tools that health workers already use, can limit the fragmentation of the digital health 
enterprise and support the sustainability of your intervention.

BID INITIATIVE  
CASE STUDY 
BID Initiative: Data quality and use interventions
Together with end-users from all levels of the health system, the BID Initiative collaboratively developed 
a comprehensive set of tools and approaches to improve immunization data collection, quality and use 
spanning data-management policies and practices, information system products and training on the tools, 
as well as methods for better using data to make critical decisions about immunization services. These 
improvements included the following:
» an electronic immunization application (EIR) linked to a client registry (Tanzania only) and supply chain 
information
» automated, simplified report generation
» data-use campaigns
» microtraining videos
» peer-support networks
» barcodes or QR codes on child health cards and vaccine supplies
» targeted supportive supervision for health workers
» data visualizations and dashboards to monitor facility and neighbouring facility performance.
The BID team applied a “top-down” approach with a “bottom-up” view when drafting these interventions. 
They started by considering Tanzania’s and Zambia’s national strategies, incorporating the current context 
of the end-users (such as the functional architecture) before considering the facility applications (such as 
the technical architecture) that were in use. With key stakeholders, they also assessed existing information 
systems and how they matched the defined requirements, along with the projects and pilots that had come 
before, so as not to duplicate efforts or invest in technologies and strategies that do not yield a high impact.

Identifying existing digital health interventions to use for your planned work can be challenging. WHO’s 
Digital Health Atlas (DHA) can help you conduct a digital health inventory (8). The DHA is a web-based tool for 
cataloguing and tracking digital health implementations. Searching the DHA for implementations filtered by 
health domain, health system challenge area, software applications or context may reveal opportunities for reuse 
and collaboration. 
You may also consider tapping into existing communities of practices, such as the Global Digital Health Network 
(62) or a regional network like the AeHIN (63). In some cases, a recent landscape report highlighting other digital 
health interventions and ICT systems in the country may be available. These repositories may include current 
as well as historical deployments that have ended for reasons other than funding cessation; insights from such 
deployments may help you smartly plan for and avoid pitfalls that others have faced. Examples of such landscape 
analysis reports include the following:

5.1  Infrastructure considerations
Many digital health applications and platforms have seen limited adoption and success because they 
were piloted in areas that had inadequate access to electricity and mobile networks or were otherwise 
inappropriately designed for the context. Understanding the available infrastructure is foundational to defining 
the scope and feasibility of the digital health application. Several practical approaches help alleviate constraints 
posed by infrastructural limitations. For example, erratic power supply and Internet connectivity may cause 
challenges when uploading data to a central computer in real time and may even result in data loss. However, if 
you know about connectivity issues during the planning stages, you could design the digital health application 
to facilitate offline data collection, supported by manual transfer of data to a central computer where the data 
are stored. Similarly, if irregular access to electricity keeps end-users from charging digital devices, you could 
consider alternatives during planning, such as battery packs or solar chargers.
In the early stages of planning, consider the following DEVICES: What types of devices can be sourced locally?

overstate connectivity or present only a snapshot of the 
coverage. If you plan to scale to regions with unreliable 
connectivity, consider interventions and applications 
that can work offline, and adequately plan for the 
amount of data that may be needed to be stored offline 
to ensure that the application still performs well with 
large amounts of data waiting to be sent to server.
Plan the implementation 69
5.2 Legislation, policy and compliance considerations
It is important to understand the national policies and regulations that may apply and explore relevant global 
best practices when national policies are lacking. These could include regulations for hosting data and using 
personally identifiable information, processes for informed consent, relevant standards and linkages with other 
systems. A successful digital health implementation plan will assess the current policy environment, adapt the 
design to that environment and ensure that policies are sufficiently implemented. Evaluate these considerations 
in conjunction with leadership and governance considerations (see section 5.3), as sound policy relies on leaders 
and governance structures to ensure its effectiveness and accountability (69, 70, 71).

Box 5.2.1.1.  Examples of policies for data protection and regulation.
When defining the guidelines, consider principles of assessment, such as the UN Global Pulse’s Risk, harms and 
benefits assessment tool (72). This resource serves as an internal tool to better understand data privacy, ethics 
and data-protection compliance mechanisms associated with use of big data in development and humanitarian 
contexts. 
The General Data Protection Regulation developed by the European Union provides useful considerations for 
managing data protection, privacy and security. These include client rights to1:
» be informed on how their data will be used
» access their data
» correct or rectify the collected data
» have their data deleted, or “be forgotten”, if the data were collected unlawfully or deemed no longer necessary 
» restrict data processing or completely object to the processing of personal data for the purposes of 
advertising or direct marketing
» transfer the data to another party without interference (73).
Guidance from CDC2 and UNAIDs3 on data security, privacy and confidentiality; and relevant standards curated by 
ISO TC 215 on health informatics4 will provide additional operational and technical requirements. 
The African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection provides similar articles, including 
these examples:
» Article 18 The right to object: Any person has the right to object, on legitimate grounds, to the processing 
of the data relating to him/her. He/She shall have the right to be informed before personal data relating to 
him/her are disclosed for the first to third parties or used on their behalf for the purposes of marketing, and 
to be expressly offered the right to object, free of charge, to such disclosures or uses.
» Article 21 Security obligations: The data controller must take all appropriate precautions, according to the 
nature of the data, and in particular to prevent such data from being altered or destroyed, or accessed by 
unauthorized third parties. (74)
While establishing such policies in countries is critical, raising awareness of and enforcing these policies are 
equally important.

5.3  Leadership and governance considerations
Having a clear understanding of the governance and leadership structure will help you craft an inclusive 
planning process and foster a sense of ownership of the implementation. Governance may include a steering 
committee or a decision-making board composed of a range of stakeholders (see Chapter 2). Engaging the right 
stakeholders from the beginning increases the possibility that they will incorporate future investments in the 
implementation into their annual budgets and workplans (29, 69, 78,  79).

5.4  Workforce and training considerations
Chapter 2 listed the key governance, management and operations personnel needed for a digital health 
implementation. At this point, you will focus on the workforce directly involved in the digital health enterprise, 
such as community and facility health workers and healthcare managers. Although some health workers will 
show great enthusiasm for new technologies, introducing and institutionalizing the intervention with all of the 
workforce or client end-users can be challenging.

BID INITIATIVE 
CASE STUDY
BID Initiative: Workforce implementation
The BID Initiative developed a workforce implementation strategy (80) informed by John Kotter’s eight-step 
model for change management (see Fig. 5.4.1). “Touches”, or visits, were used to introduce and provide training 
on new tools and approaches, allowing health workers time to internalize the practice of data analysis and 
use (see Fig. 5.4.2). Successful implementation requires buy-in from local health workers, so BID centred its 
approach on health workers, both as trainers and trainees. Instead of having BID Initiative staff lead touches, 
district immunization officers led activities within facilities and provided direct support to health workers.

5.5  Services and applications 
Services and applications are the devices and tools, including software, used to collect, transmit, access and 
maintain health information, including the ICT systems that your digital health interventions will integrate 
with and leverage (3). Services include digital registries for health workforce, master patient indexes and health 
facilities, and applications include a variety of software and ICT systems that may be operating in your country, 
such as HMIS, indicator-reporting dashboards, and terminology and identity management services, as well 
as any enabling components like the interoperability layer. Although specific requirements for services and 
applications will differ based on the digital health interventions that you have selected, consider the following

5.6  Standards and interoperability 
Standards and interoperability are also critical factors for ensuring the success of digital health 
implementations. For different systems to be interoperable, or to meaningfully exchange information with one 
another, procedures and data standards must be established that ensure a common language and facilitate data 
exchange. Interoperability is not only critical for driving cost efficiencies and reducing fragmentation across 
different digital systems, but is also necessary to support the continuity of care as patients engage at different 
points of service in the health system, and the digital health enterprise will need to ensure the golden thread of 
continuity is maintained across each provider and facility. 
Chapter 6 will elaborate on the concepts of standards broader digital health enterprise architecture. Skipping 
and interoperability and describe how the proposed this review step may result in a fragmented and siloed 
digital health implementation can further link to a digital health implementation.
Box 5.6.1.  General considerations for standards and interoperability.
Where appropriate, link to identification registries, such as a national health workforce registry, client 
registry or master facility list. For example, some countries have a facility registry with a master facility list that 
includes unique identifiers of health facilities and related information on the services they provide. The facility 
registry provides an identification number that can link different applications, such as electronic medical records 
and a telemedicine system. A similar example is a health worker registry, which provides unique identifiers for 
each health worker. These identifiers can facilitate exchanging data across the different applications in which 
digital health interventions are housed. 
Use data standards for exchanging health information. Global bodies such as Health Level 7 (HL7), International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD) and International Health Exchange have established standards, rules that 
allow information to be shared and processed in a uniform, consistent manner (88, 89). These data standards 
allow stakeholders to align on common data models, which then facilitates exchanging information across 
components of the digital health enterprise. For example, data terms used in an HMIS need to align with data 
terms used in an electronic medical record to allow comparison of indicators and analysis of health information. 
Developing a dictionary of health terms can be a gradual process that uses already established data standards 
while also curating local data.
5.7  National digital health strategy and  
investment plan
Determine whether you have a national digital health or eHealth strategy, and review the priorities, policies and 
operational aspects to establish areas of alignment and differences. The digital health strategy may detail the 
current policies and different enabling factors, which are critical to understanding the readiness of the national 
environment to support additional digital health applications. Also determine whether a national investment 
planning process has been conducted detailing the status, functionality, maturity and inventory of the national 
digital health enterprise and any plans for future digital health investments that may align with your needs.

CASE STUDY
mHero – using data standards to effectively integrate  
different digital health interventions
mHero combines three technologies – IntraHealth’s iHRIS software, UNICEF’s RapidPro and Jembi’s OpenHIM 
– into a powerful communication tool for ministry and health workers (90). 
iHRIS is open source health workforce information system software used to capture and maintain 
information for planning, managing, regulating and training the health workforce. RapidPro is an open source 
platform for building an interactive messaging system. OpenHIM is an interoperability layer for standards-
compliant health information exchange, such as OpenHIE.
The combined tool, mHero, allows the MOH to instantly send information to health workers’ mobile phones 
and enables health workers to send time-sensitive information back to ministry officials. This was done 
through rigorous adoption of open international standards, such as HL7 FHIR, for health data exchange, based 
on the OpenHIE framework. By using these standards, information about the health workers could be derived 
from the health workforce registry (iHRIS) and then used by the RapidPro messaging system to seamlessly 
communicate with health workers around the country (see Fig. 5.6.2). For example, information on the health 
facility associated with the health worker could be used as a way to target the messaging to health workers. 
Furthermore, the open source and open standards approach means that the mHero platform does not depend 
on any specific piece of software, which allows MOHs to readily integrate mHero into their HIS.

82 Digital implementation investment guide
Over the course of the previous chapters, you developed a plan for a digital health implementation focused on 
addressing identified health system challenges, with a clear understanding of the digital health interventions 
and other functionalities required. To advance this from being a siloed digital health implementation to an 
exchanged digital health system architecture (see Fig. 1.3.1), it is also important to consider the costs and 
implementation requirements that would enable you to cohesively benefit from and support the broader digital 
health enterprise, avoiding the missteps of investing in fragmented digital systems or ball-of-mud software 
applications trying to do everything. When investments in digital health implementations are aligned with 
a nationally governed digital health enterprise architecture, in which systems contribute to and derive value 
from one another, the potential for your implementation to be sustained, scaled and institutionalized is greatly 
improved. In contexts where there may not be a defined digital health enterprise architecture, ITU’s Digital 
health platform handbook (14) and the OpenHIE architecture specification (91) and community of practice (18) 
offer useful resources for planning a digital health enterprise architecture.
6.1  Assess the digital health enterprise architecture
A digital health enterprise architecture, if available in the country, outlines current and planned business 
processes, data, systems and technologies and provides an overview of the standards, information exchange 
and interoperability profiles that can be optimized across the enterprise. A clearly established enterprise 
architecture describing how different processes, data, systems and technologies function together is crucial 
for guiding interoperability to support data exchange between digital health applications, as well as collective 
functioning goals. An enterprise architecture blueprint lays the foundation for scaling up and sustaining digital 
health applications that are standardized and interoperable and that will facilitate access to higher quality, more 
complete information, in turn resulting in better decisions and more improved health outcomes across multiple 
areas. The architectural approach provides a view of all the necessary building blocks and a rational method of 
understanding, defining and manageably implementing digital health interventions. 
Typically, there are four layers, or viewpoints, that functional architecture. The technical architecture

aspects are based on the health programme needs, interoperability.

BID INITIATIVE 
CASE STUDY
BID Initiative: Enterprise architecture approach
Multiple disconnected health data systems can stunt the efforts and potential of new technologies. 
Successful digital health enterprises take stock of the existing landscape and build upon it, with the goal of 
sustaining efforts well beyond a project life span. The BID Initiative worked closely with the governments 
of Tanzania and Zambia to integrate interventions into the broader health system and overarching health 
strategies.
The BID Initiative defined its enterprise architecture in terms of whole-system behaviours rather than 
specific technologies. It was not intended to be a definitive description of any single country’s health 
enterprise architecture, but rather intended as a starting point that could adapt to a specific country’s needs 
and reflect its unique context.
A number of core principles drove the architectural choices reflected in the BID design.
» Data collection is integrated into the workflow. This principle reflects the fact that for data quality 
and timeliness to improve, the use of data must be woven into the fabric of each workflow participant’s 
business processes. All data will be captured electronically, as soon as possible and as close as possible 
to the step in the workflow where the data are generated.
» Data will be shared to support multiple workflows. As an example of this principle, child 
immunization transactions can be leveraged to track inventory transactions.
» Users have access to the data necessary to perform their duties. One of BID’s objectives was to 
improve data quality and use; therefore, the workflow participants must have access to actionable, 
readily understandable data.
» Interoperability and openness: The preference was to adopt existing standards wherever possible 
and to adapt them where necessary. There was no expectation that new standards would need to be 
developed to support the BID Initiative.
» Sustainability: This principle means that simple, stable, readily adoptable solutions would be favoured 
over technologically “sophisticated” ones that would be difficult to deploy nationally. Communications 
infrastructure would be leveraged and centralized ICT solutions preferred over ones that are 
decentralized.

Link the digital health implementation to the enterprise architecture 85
6.2  Identify common and enabling components and 
shared services (digital health platform)
When linking your digital health implementation to the broader digital health enterprise architecture, consider 
the core functionalities, or components, that are unique to your use case or health programme, as well as 
the components that can be generalized and reused in other health programme areas or even beyond the 
health sector. These common components (also called reusable components) represent opportunities for 
joint investment, allowing you to stitch together and harmonize different digital health interventions across 
programme areas and even sectors, while also facilitating the establishment of a common architecture from 
which all digital health implementations can benefit (see Fig. 6.2.2). Think of these common components as 
like roads and water pipes – “build once, use multiple times” – that you are likely to need for your digital health 
implementation and that others will also need and can collectively contribute towards and benefit from in 
subsequent adaptations and deployments. These reusable components may also be used outside the health 
sector, such as in education and social protection. The collective of common components is known as the digital 
health platform and can be subdivided into shared services and enabling components.
You could align your digital health implementation

implementation. Table 7.2.1 also describes important considerations to take into account when estimating 
costs. For additional guidance,  consider consulting other tools, such as ADB’s digital health investment

BID INITIATIVE  
CASE STUDY
BID Initiative: How much does an EIR cost?
How much does it cost to implement BID Initiative interventions in the test sites in Tanzania and Zambia? 
What are the up-front and recurring costs of operating BID interventions? What are the resources required 
to implement interventions in each district? How do the costs of providing immunization services and 
reporting compare before and after BID interventions are implemented?
These are some of the key costing questions the BID team asked as it planned to implement interventions in 
health facilities in Tanzania and Zambia. The answers were used to make decisions about implementation, 
scaling and adaptation.
PATH health economists led an economic evaluation assessing both the financial and economic costs of 
implementing BID interventions in Tanzania and Zambia. A key component of this evaluation involved 
estimating the total cost of ownership of BID interventions, including the financial costs incurred to develop, 
deploy, integrate, scale and sustain the interventions (see Table 7.2.2 for more detailed cost drivers). The data 
to estimate the total cost of ownership were gathered from project records and through tracking resources 
used by implementation teams.

Adapted from Mvundera et al.,  2019 (95).
The economic evaluation showed the following results.
» Costs of developing, deploying and maintaining EIRs are less than 10 US dollars per child under 1 year of 
age, but can be less than 5 US dollars per child in a country like Tanzania that has a large birth cohort.
» Hardware and deployment of the EIRs are the cost categories that account for a large share of these 
costs (95).
BID believes that subsequent EIR development and deployment costs may be even less because of the 
ability of other low- and middle-income countries to leverage the EIR systems that were developed for 
Tanzania and Zambia as well as through leveraging learnings generated from these deployments.

Develop a budget 99
7.3  Budget matrix
Once you have identified your cost categories by investment phase and the related drivers of those cost 
categories, use a budget matrix (see Table 7.3.1) to create a detailed budget for your implementation across the 
expected life span before the intervention will require significant updates. This time frame is typically about five 
years but could be longer or shorter depending on the selected intervention. Budget matrices are also useful 
for comparing costs across digital health interventions. You could use financial data in historical procurement 
records and from past implementations, along with RFPs from developers and implementers, to complete the 
budget matrix.
In creating your budget, be sure to indicate components that would be funded through the existing programme to 
show country and partner co-investment. A detailed budget template is included in Annex 7.1.

While preparing your costed implementation plan, you should also be able to demonstrate how this investment will 
improve the status quo in terms of projected impact. This may include proving the comparative value of this digital 
health investment over other types of activities, including nondigital investments. Modelling methodologies, such as 
the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), can help project the overall health impact of the investment. More details on how to apply 
this tool to digital health investments and examples of impact projections for different digital health interventions can 
be found in the Asian Development Bank’s Digital health impact framework (97).

DRIVEN1 + Present data in formats that are easy to interpret and act on, such as data 
visualizations.
+ Create a culture of data use by prioritizing capacity-building and data-use efforts 
across all stakeholder groups, including the groups whose data are being collected.
+ Be holistic about data collection and analysis. Collect data from multiple 
sources, and use a mix of data collection and analysis methods. Analyse your data 
collaboratively with stakeholders.
+ Identify and use open data and interoperability standards.
+ Collect and use data responsibly according to international norms and standards.

102 Digital implementation investment guide
After going through the steps to plan the digital health implementation but prior to deploying the 
implementation, you can embed mechanisms to monitor the implementation, such as collecting baseline data, 
and use the insights from the emerging data to increase your implementation’s impact and efficiency. Continual 
monitoring of activities at different stages of the implementation is critical for ensuring its long-term success, as 
is responding to external changes and new learnings.

CASE STUDY
Myanmar “Learning for Impact” model of continuous monitoring
UNFPA Myanmar developed the Love Question, Life Answer (LQLA) mobile application to promote 
accessibility of evidence-based information about life skills and sexual and reproductive health and rights 
to adolescents and young people in and out of school in Myanmar. Through active promotion on different 
channels, the number of downloads reached more than 43 000 end-users by the end of 2018. As the app was 
being deployed, UNFPA determined that it would not be sufficient to measure only the end-users.
To improve monitoring and uptake of the app, UNFPA designed a suite of routine practical tools known 
as Learning for Impact. The Learning for Impact monitoring approach looks at the categories of system 
performance, usage, engagement, health outputs and health outcomes, each linked to objective metrics. 
Through this continuous monitoring, implementation teams can make corrective actions to refine different 
aspects of the deployment.

Box 8.3.2.  Immunization Data: Evidence for Action. 
The Immunization Data: Evidence for Action (IDEA) review is a global synthesis of existing evidence aimed at 
increasing the use of high-quality data to improve immunization coverage (100). It provides a clearer picture 
of what works to improve immunization data use, why it works and where knowledge gaps still exist. The 
systematic realist review considered nearly 550 documents, including published literature, working papers, 
project evaluations and reports. The following are some key findings from the review: interconnected and 
comprehensive strategies provide stronger results; data use leads to increase of quality of data; and efforts to 
systematize data use lead to long-term intervention success. Additional information and resources can be found 
at Technet-21 (101).

BID INITIATIVE 
CASE STUDY
The following are key learnings from implementing these data-use interventions in Tanzania and Zambia. 
» Teach data-analysis skills with the facility’s existing data to help nurses identify challenges 
currently affecting service delivery and pinpoint ways to address those issues. This foundation in 
data analysis better prepares nurses to adopt new tools and to adapt their data-analysis skill sets to 
different service areas, such as malaria.
» Electronic tools, as well as revised paper forms, must go through an iterative process with 
feedback from facility, district, regional and provincial members of UAGs. This allows software 
developers to understand how health workers will use data and information and ensures the creation 
of intuitive tools that enable access to data for planning and service delivery.
» Use targeted, supportive supervision and tools, such as job aids and dashboards, for data 
visualization to identify low-performing facilities. These tools should also present a methodology 
to walk through the challenges associated with the facility’s performance, as well as an approach to 
identify steps to improve performance.
» Create peer-support networks to connect health workers with other facilities in their district. 
These networks provide an opportunity for nurses to ask questions of one another and to receive 
support in real time using messenger platforms like WhatsApp. For instance, health workers may pose 
questions about how to calculate indicators. Regional leads may also use the network to communicate 
with nurses and facility in-charges by sharing immunization updates.
» Engage regional-, provincial- and national-level stakeholders. Although nurses at the facility and 
district level are the critical data end-users and will benefit from greater data visibility, stakeholders 
at all levels should be involved to foster a culture of data use across the health system. Readiness 
assessment tools and data dashboards for decision-making enable management of that change.
The following are additional tools developed by the BID Initiative for building a culture of data use:
» Spot check form (104) 
» Data-use culture job aid (105)

Work from the beginning with a core group of stakeholders across the government and other key 
organizations. This will ensure a complete understanding of the challenges to be addressed and that the 
solutions address those challenges and meet end-user needs.
Build key champions within the government and key stakeholder groups. These champions are essential to 
advocate for adopting solutions and long-term funding.
Balance the need for a “proof of concept” (seeing it to believe it works) with the need to begin sustainability 
planning. The key issues of technical capacity, policy environment and financing need to be considered from 
the beginning.
Create a realistic, shared vision among partners and the government from the start. This vision will cover 
what needs to be in place for sustainability (infrastructure, policy, capacity and financing) and determine 
how to implement process or system changes.
Secure costing data as quickly as possible (including cost estimates if necessary). This will build 
understanding of both the level of financing required and the savings possible in other budget areas because 
of greater efficiencies and smoother processes.

Annex 5.1  Questions for software developers
As you select the specific applications that you will use in the digital health implementation, it is critical to have some 
background information on the level of support that software developers will provide, as well as the capabilities of the 
software application. This worksheet provides key questions that can be used to guide your discussion with a particular 
software developer. This worksheet could also be used as a guide for creating a proposal scoring rubric.19

This annex describes specific implementation considerations for a selected set of digital health interventions. These 
specific considerations are in addition to the factors discussed in Chapter 5 that relate to general implementation 
considerations for all interventions.
The interventions listed in this appendix are based on the interventions that were prioritized in the WHO Guideline: 
Recommendations on Digital Interventions for Health System Strengthening, which include:
» birth and death notification
» stock notification and commodity management 
» client-to-provider telemedicine
» provider-to-provider telemedicine
» targeted client communication 
» health worker decision support 
» digital health record for tracking of patients’/clients’ health status and services 
» provision of training and educational content to health workers via mobile devices (mLearning).
INTERVENTION 1: BIRTH AND DEATH NOTIFICATION
DESCRIPTION 
OF THE DIGITAL Digital approaches to support the notification of births and deaths in order to trigger subsequent steps

INTERVENTION
» Lack of access to information or data (lack of reporting of events)
COMMONLY » Lack of population denominator

» Lack of quality/reliable data
HEALTH SYSTEM 
CHALLENGES » Inadequate understanding of beneficiary populations
» Lack of unique identifier
» Align to national policies and laws for legal identity, as well as issuance of unique IDs. This 
intervention should strengthen the entire CRVS and avoid developing systems that do not link to 
health services or CRVS systems. For example, is the health system allowed to notify about vital

» Explore sociocultural barriers associated with communicating about births/deaths and address 
the way these dynamics will influence notifications via digital devices.
20  Adapted from Classification of digital health interventions: a shared language to describe the uses of digital technology for health. Geneva: WHO; 
2018 (https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/mhealth/classification-digital-health-interventions/en/).
138 Digital implementation investment guide
» Consider mechanisms to ensure the completeness of the data and whether demand-generation 
activities are needed to incentivize reporting by explaining its benefits. Implementers should 
be aware, however, of any reporting targets placed on health workers and ensure that birth and 
death data are validated before being released to the civil registration system.
CONSIDERATIONS » Consider processes for deduplication/validation of the notification. Strengthen processes to 
DURIN G ensure that all notifications lead to both legal registration and issuance of certificates.
DEPLOYMENT » Consider how best to ensure the quality and timeliness of birth and death data, such as by 
checking on low performers identified through digital performance data or spot checks. Other 
ways to help improve data quality include standardizing the definitions associated with reporting 
birth and death events, such as for stillbirths, and making these definitions accessible to those 
inputting the data.

AGES TO OTHER 
to consider whether the civil registration system can absorb an increase in notifications.
DIGITAL HEALTH  
INTERVENTIONS
There is a risk in overinvesting in notifications without a robust civil registry system on the back end. 
Without this, notifications will have no legal value, and the data are less likely to be properly stored 
and managed. 
Implementers should note that increases in notifications will in turn require that the health system 
RISKS AND and civil registration services be prepared to absorb higher demand for registration. This is a potential 
MITIGATION bottleneck in the registration and validation process and could deter populations from continuing 
STRATEGIES notifications. Consider how to improve accessibility and shorten the connection between the health 
workers or communities providing the notifications and the CRVS sector undertaking the registration. 
Data on births/deaths may be particularly vulnerable for financial value (for example, information used 
for advertising and marketing). Establish mechanisms to preserve data privacy, ownership, access, 
integrity and protection of patient information.

INTERVENTION 2: STOCK NOTIFICATION AND COMMODIT Y MANAGEMENT
DESCRIPTION Digital approaches for monitoring stock levels and distribution of medical commodities, which can 
OF THE DIGITAL include using communication systems (such as SMS) and data dashboards to manage and report on 
HEALTH supply levels of medical commodities22 
INTERVENTION
COMMONLY » Insufficient supply of commodities (which could be attributed to wastage of expired stocks due 
ASSOCIATED to lack of good planning, forecasting and redistribution systems)
HEALTH SYSTEM » Geographic inaccessibility
CHALLENGES » Lack of effective resource allocation
» Lack of transparency in commodity transactions
» Delayed reporting of events
CONSIDERATIONS Consider the need for training at all levels of the health system, including training of health workers 
BEFORE to send stock reports, of support staff (such as cold-chain technicians) to manage stock and of facility 
DEPLOYING workers to assess stock levels.
Reinforce training by the basic processes of inventory management and stock distribution. Since 
management staff at national and subnational levels make decisions according to the data on whether 
or not to supply health facilities and health workers with stock replenishments, introducing the digital 
system should also be accompanied by refresher training on the basic processes of supply chain 
management. 
CONSIDERATIONS » Ensure that the digital systems and ordering routines are flexible enough to respond to local

OPPORTUNITIES Prioritize integrating notifications with existing data reporting systems, including national or 
FOR INTEROPERA- subnational information management systems where available, such as supply chain, logistics and 
BILIT Y AND LINK- warehouse management information systems. 
AGES TO OTHER Consider integrating the stock notification system with a data dashboard that displays the 
DIGITAL HEALTH  notification, receipt of commodity at the station and action taken, among other data, to ensure 
INTERVENTIONS transparency.
RISKS AND The digital reporting of stock levels will introduce a level of transparency in commodity transactions 
MITIGATION that may be new to the health system. Ensure that there is no harm or reprisal to health workers for 
STRATEGIES reporting stockouts or wastage; instead, emphasize explaining the benefits of reporting stockouts so 
that they can be addressed. To motivate continued reporting, ensure that some action is possible when 
stockouts are reported.

COMMONLY » Low demand for services
ASSOCIATED » Low adherence to treatments
HEALTH SYSTEM » Loss to follow-up
CHALLENGES » Insufficient patient engagement
» Unaware of service entitlement
» Lack of access to information
» Lack of alignment with local norms (stigma)
CONSIDERATIONS » Determine the mechanisms to enrol the targeted population in the service, such as through 
BEFORE health appointments, advertised short codes, community outreach and so on.
DEPLOYING » Ensure that clients are actively made aware of how to opt out of receiving the targeted client 
communication. Attention needs to be paid to clearly communicating consent procedures to 
clients. Inform clients on the intended uses of their data, including to enable subsequent further 
contact with them and over what period of time, and their right to be forgotten/opt out. 
» Ensure that the content of the communication accurately reflects the reality of the available 
commodities and services. For example, encouraging women to seek family planning at their 
nearest health facility is appropriate if a full range of contraception and advice is available there, 
including the relevant commodities.
» Consider testing to ensure that the messages are understood as intended and that any necessary 
colloquial translations are used. Consider the languages used for the content to reach the target 
audiences, including whether they are in active spoken or written use. Also consider anti-spam 
regulations and test that messages are not caught in spam filters.
» Consider whether to include two-way communication with clients to enable their interaction 
and response to the health system.
CONSIDERATIONS Pay attention to the circumstances of people who have poor access to electricity or poor network 
DURING coverage, people who cannot afford a mobile device or voice and data charges, and people who have 
DEPLOYMENT limited autonomy, because their access to phones is controlled by another person, for example. 
Give particular attention to the needs, preferences and circumstances of especially disadvantaged or

INTERVENTION 6: HEALTH WORKER DECISION SUPPORT
DESCRIPTION Digitized job aids that combine an individual’s health information with the health worker’s knowledge 
OF THE DIGITAL and clinical protocols to assist health workers in making diagnosis and treatment decisions26
HEALTH 
INTERVENTION
COMMONLY » Poor adherence to guidelines
ASSOCIATED » Inadequate supportive supervision
HEALTH SYSTEM » Lack of or inappropriate referrals
CHALLENGES » Insufficient supply (coverage) of qualified health workers
» Insufficient health worker competence
CONSIDERATIONS » Check the relevance and quality of the decision-support content (such as algorithms) and that 
BEFORE it aligns with evidence-based clinical guidance, such as WHO or national guidance. This type of 
DEPLOYING validation can be done through mechanisms like an independent review and using mock cases 
to test the intended output from the algorithms. Also consider built-in mechanisms to update 
content remotely as algorithms evolve.
» Assess health workers’ skills and knowledge to ensure that they have adequate capacity to obtain 
accurate data before input, to avoid erroneous outputs.
CONSIDERATIONS » Make sure that health workers understand during training that the support provided is based 
DURING on existing guidelines and policy. While health workers may deviate from the recommendations, 
DEPLOYMENT they should be clear about their rationale for doing so. Where possible, enable cases to be 
documented in which health workers feel they need to deviate from the guidance proposed by 
the decision-support system.
» Health workers should consider explaining the use of devices and seeking clients’ permission 
before using them to improve the acceptability to patients of using digital decision-support 
devices. Patients should also be made aware that the information from the counselling may 
be saved and used at future visits to improve quality and continuity. Any concerns with 
acceptability may be mitigated by, for example, health workers showing the patient the inputs 
and results or listening to the messages or videos together so that the device does not become a 
barrier in the consultation.
» Improve awareness among staff and supervisors about the value of portable devices, and develop 
ground rules or codes of conduct for when and how devices should be used.
OPPORTUNITIES Consider integrating decision-support tools with patient health records, such as digital health records 
FOR INTEROPERA- for tracking clients’ health status and services, to more easily incorporate the patient’s health history.
BILIT Y AND LINK- Consider integrating decision-support tools with digital tools for planning and scheduling health 
AGES TO OTHER worker activity.
DIGITAL HEALTH  
INTERVENTIONS
RISKS AND Issues with unvalidated or erroneous content/algorithms can result in poor quality of care. The 
MITIGATION underlying content needs to undergo thorough rounds of validation and testing and be rooted in 
STRATEGIES reliable sources, such as national clinical protocols and global guidelines. 
Decision-support algorithms can be quite complex, so be sure to build in adequate time for testing 
all the paths of the algorithm with any changes to the software. Consider using automated tools for 
testing.
Consider that following the algorithm may mean that health workers spend more time with clients 
(rather than skipping steps). This may result in frustration for health workers who have an increased 
workload and clients who face longer waiting periods. Share results of improved adherence to 
guidelines with health workers and explain the benefits of higher quality care to clients (to justify 
waits); in some settings, many of the follow-up visits may be eliminated because correct care is given 
the first time, thus ultimately saving the clients and health workers time.
Referral linkages may need to be strengthened to support possible increases in the number of patients 
seeking care for previously undetected needs now being revealed by the decision-support system.

DESCRIPTION Digitized record used to capture, store, access and share health information on a client or grouping 
OF THE DIGITAL of clients, which may include digital service records, digital forms of paper-based registers for 
HEALTH longitudinal health programmes and case management logs within specific target populations, 
INTERVENTION including migrant populations27
COMMONLY » Delayed reporting of events
ASSOCIATED » Lack of quality/reliable data
HEALTH SYSTEM » Insufficient continuity of care
CHALLENGES » Delayed provision of care
» Poor planning and coordination
CONSIDERATIONS » Ensure that adequate policy and legal processes and protections, using either a card-based or 
BEFORE biometric-based identifier, and telecommunications infrastructure are consistently available 
DEPLOYING across facilities and programmes to provide accurate patient identification and facilitate the 
digital tracking of health services.
» Consider whether the digital health records for tracking clients’ health status and services have 
adequate infrastructural support to be maintained over time. Start-up costs and infrastructural 
requirements for a digital tracking system tend to be higher than for paper-based interventions. 
When used appropriately and effectively, the costs of digital health interventions are amortized, 
and cost savings may be realized in the long run. However, in contexts where basic health 
infrastructure is limited, including human resources like supervisors and managers, the digital 
tracking system may be very resource intensive.
CONSIDERATIONS » Consider an incremental approach in transitioning from a paper-based data collection form to 
DURING a digital form. Closely following the layout of the paper-based form in the digital format may 
DEPLOYMENT reduce end-users’ learning curve. Additionally, instead of creating an application that captures all 
disease or health areas simultaneously, consider a step-by-step approach, introducing end-users 
to modules gradually before adding new ones.
» Improve awareness among staff and supervisors about the value of portable devices, and develop 
ground rules or codes of conduct for when and how devices should be used.
OPPORTUNITIES Link to unique identifiers, such as a local or national ID system, to provide a foundational digital 
FOR INTEROPERA- identity that can facilitate longitudinal follow-up and linkages to other systems and digital health

INTERVENTIONS health record and tracking patient history. 
Integrate with commodity-reporting systems/LMIS to record supplies used during visits (rapid 
diagnostic tests, medicines, condoms distributed and so on).

Annexes 153
RISKS AND Health workers may face the added work burden of operating a dual system when using both a 
MITIGATION manual/paper-based system and the digital tool. Establish a plan or processes to replace manual/
STRATEGIES paper-based systems or account for the dual burden of managing these two systems.
Consider local policies on digital identities when designing a programme to ensure that the 
programme does no harm. Digital tracking of individuals’ health status may be controversial in some 
circumstances, such as among refugees or other groups who lack firm legal status in particular 
settings. The extent to which such groups may trust tracking depends on who is doing the tracking and 
how the information is likely to be used.

INTERVENTION 8:  DIGITAL PROVISION OF TRAINING AND EDUCATIONAL 
CONTENT TO HEALTH WORKERS
DESCRIPTION Management and provision of education and training content in electronic form for health 
OF THE DIGITAL professionals; in contrast to decision support, health worker training does not need to be used at the 
HEALTH point of care28
INTERVENTION
COMMONLY » Insufficient health worker competence
ASSOCIATED » Poor adherence to guidelines
HEALTH SYSTEM » Inadequate supportive supervision
CHALLENGES » Lack of or inappropriate referrals
CONSIDERATIONS » Ensure that the information is from a source considered trustworthy and credible by health 
BEFORE workers in your setting. For example, the information loaded on the mLearning system should be 
DEPLOYING based on validated content or should align with national or WHO clinical guidance.
» Ensure that the programme is end-user tested among health workers, both those in practice and 
those in training, to ensure that their needs and concerns are met. 
» Consider network capacity and coverage, especially if mLearning materials may be videos, which 
can be time-consuming to download in certain settings.
» Consider usage needs of the mLearning content, as to whether or not you need to report on 
which resources are accessed more frequently than others, how many times and during what 
times of day, and then ensure that systems/applications can support these needs.
CONSIDERATIONS » Improve awareness among staff and supervisors about the value of portable devices and develop 
DURING ground rules or codes of conduct for when and how devices should be used to increase the 
DEPLOYMENT acceptability of mLearning.
» Consider if health workers can earn credits for continuing education using these materials as a 
way of increasing their uptake.
» Involve the relevant professional bodies, including national certification or institutional boards, 
to ensure that the content of the mLearning programmes aligns with current scopes of practice 
and national training curricula for health workers.
OPPORTUNITIES Embed mLearning content on devices used by health workers for other digital health interventions to 
FOR INTEROPERA- help maximize resources and enable health workers to access content on a routine basis.
BILIT Y AND LINK- Link mLearning with human resource information systems to update certification of health workers.
