Large scale test: MTIBA program with 10,000 
users and 44 clinics in 5 Nairobi slums
• MTIBA program with health vouchers 
launched with Safaricom in March
• Rolled out to 44 clinics and 10,000 
mothers in 5 slums in Nairobi
• Voucher to be spent on the healthcare 
for children under 5 years old
• For each MTIBA transaction clinic 
submits relevant medical & financial 
data in real-time
• Administration costs radically reduced 
and pay-out times significantly 
shortened vs traditional voucher or 
insurance schemes → clinic is paid 
within days instead of months

Key messages
• To make mHealth a success, strong partnerships with mobile network 
operators, donors and public sector are critical
• Key to success (especially also with private sector companies such as 
Safaricom) is involving these stakeholders at an early stage
• First experiences with a mobile health wallet suggest it can:
• Unify contributions from government, donors, employers, insurers 
and individuals directly in the mobile phone of the end-beneficiary
• Radically reduce administration costs
• Radically speed up pay-out times to healthcare providers
• Generate real-time medical data from the most remote locations
