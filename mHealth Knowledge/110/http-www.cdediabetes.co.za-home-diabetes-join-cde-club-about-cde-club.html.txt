What is the CDE Club?
Managing your diabetes can often be a struggle, trying to balance eating, medication and physical activity. We as the CDE appreciate this struggle and therefore want to make living with diabetes a little easier. If this sounds good, then let us introduce to you the CDE Club.
The Four Foundations of the CDE Club
Learn
To provide you with the highest quality information regarding diabetes and other health related matters. No longer do you have to sift through the millions of articles on the web that just leave most of us confused and frustrated.
Act
Information is often not enough to change one's behavior. For example, most of us know that we should exercise, but getting up in the morning to go for a walk is often a huge battle! The CDE Club will provide you a few suggested actions that can have a huge impact on your health.
Share
To be able to share with others not only information but your success story.
Rewards
So you have achieved your goals, now it is time to reward yourself. The CDE Club will be rewarding ANYONE for achieving his or her goals. From the smallest goals to the biggest there is a reward waiting for you.
Who can join?
Anyone can join the CDE Club!
