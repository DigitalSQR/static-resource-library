Unique Health Identifier Assessment Tool Kit
Unique health identifiers help improve quality and continuum of care, strengthen surveillance of 
communicable diseases, eradicate diseases, and optimize provider and payer transactions in health financing 
schemes. They are important enablers for achieving Universal Health Coverage. Through this tool kit,  
governments and experts will learn how to assess the existing legal, policy, and institutional framework; 
information and communication technology infrastructure;  and current use of identifiers relevant for the 
health sector, to inform policy decisions on advancing unique identification in the health sector.
About the Asian Development Bank
ADB’s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member 
countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region’s many successes, 
it remains home to a large share of the world’s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive 
economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.
Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for 
helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants,

WHY
uNIQuE HEALTH 
IDENTIfIERS MATTER
Unique health identifiers are important for improving 
quality and continuum of care, strengthening surveillance of 
communicable diseases, eradicating diseases, and optimizing 
provider and payer transactions in health financing schemes.
When they can be uniquely identified, wherever and 
whenever they interact with different health service providers, 
patients have a better chance to experience continuity of 
care. Unique patient identification helps the health system 
to deliver better care, because the patients’ unique health 
identifier can help attribute medical records across different 
providers to an individual subject of care. For health insurers, 
unique health identifiers can facilitate smoother payment 
systems, leading to faster claims reimbursements. 
A unique identifier—usually a numeric or alphanumeric 
sequence ideally linked with biometric information—is 
necessary because other personal attributes to identify an 
individual such as name, date of birth, and gender can lead 
to duplications. Furthermore, these are often captured in 
different ways by different health care providers. Unique 
health identifiers, captured, for example, in a health client 
registry, are an important component of the overall enterprise 
architecture and can support strengthening information 
exchange.1
1  A health client registry is the central repository to which every player in 
the health sector should be able to connect. It stores a unique personal 
health identifier for every person who receives a health care service in a 
country. It contains patient demographics, e.g., name, date of birth, gender, 
and address. A health client registry can include individuals who are not 
eligible for inclusion in a citizen ID registry such as landed immigrants and 
refugees.
2
Introduction
Proper health identity management also supports broader 
aims: once every service user can be properly identified, it 
becomes easier to achieve universal health coverage and 
measure progress toward the targets of the Sustainable 
Development Goal for health (SDG 3). 
Malaria elimination is a prime example of the crucial role that 
unique health identifiers play in health care. To eliminate 
malaria, every malaria case must be rapidly diagnosed, treated, 
tracked, and investigated. This requires integrated registration 
systems and unique identifiers as well as interconnectivity 
and back-office capacity to handle  secure and trustworthy 
identification systems that protect privacy and prevent 
unauthorized access to health information. 
A more detailed discussion of the arguments for unique 
identifiers can be found in the Asian Development Bank 
policy brief: On The Road To Universal Health Coverage: Every 
Person Matters: Unique Identifiers for Every Citizen Are Key to an 
Effective and Equitable Health System.2

HOW THE TOOL KIT WORKS
The tool kit is a compilation of questionnaires that can be selected according to a country’s requirements. 
The questionnaires are not exhaustive but provide comprehensive guidance. The tool kit has a number of 
unique features.
1) THE TOOL KIT fOLLOWS A DRAWER AppROACH
The questionnaires in this mapping tool are divided 3. available health and health sector-related 
into three broad sections (Figure 2): registration and identification systems. 
1. legal, institutional, and political framework Within each of these three sections are several 
for identification, especially data privacy and questionnaires that can be applied in a flexible manner 
confidentiality; depending on the interviewer’s interests and focus, and 
2. information and communication technology  the expertise of the respondent to be interviewed. Each 
(ICT) infrastructure to support health and health of these questionnaires can be applied individually or 
sector-related registration and identification in combination. It is recommended to apply the main 
systems;7 questionnaires at a minimum (Figure 3).

not have sufficient ICT infrastructure in place. Other 
countries may have a comprehensive and robust 
population database in place that may serve as an 
entry point to build a patient registry, but may lack a 
robust legal framework. This tool kit will help determine 
existing conditions and help to identify opportunities 
and gaps, which in turn can inform next steps for each 
country, considering their current capacities. 
The next steps will also have to be informed by the 
technical design the country chooses to introduce a 
unique health identifier. Some countries may choose 
to establish a completely new system for patient 
identification while others may choose to build on 
existing registries and identifiers. Where a robust and 
inclusive national identification system is in place, 
countries may opt to use this foundational ID for the 
health sector. Other countries may prefer to establish 
a separate unique health identifier used solely for the 
health sector.9, 10 It is beyond the scope of this tool kit 
to discuss different policy options for a unique health 
identifier. There is no blueprint in establishing a unique 
health identifier.

fRAMEWORK
This part of the tool kit aims to retrieve information on the legal, institutional, and political framework. These 
frameworks are important conditions to build robust, secure, and well-functioning unique identification in 
the health sector. The institutional setting contributes to well-managed and coordinated implementation 
of a unique health identifier for health purposes. Laws and regulations on data privacy and protection that 
regulate how state institutions may use data are required and need to be adapted to the age of electronic 
storage and ICT usage. They are important conditions to protect individuals from inappropriate privacy 
intrusion, data misuse, and discriminatory practices. Institutional checks and balances are important 
accountability and monitoring mechanisms of institutions involved in unique identification.

health and health sector-related registration and identification systems.
The institutional capacity of individual institutions can be assessed in Module 1.2.1. Donors supporting 
activities with regard to health and health sector-related registration and identification systems can be 
mapped in the optional Module 1.A.

Unique Health Identifier Assessment Tool Kit
Unique health identifiers help improve quality and continuum of care, strengthen surveillance of 
communicable diseases, eradicate diseases, and optimize provider and payer transactions in health financing 
schemes. They are important enablers for achieving Universal Health Coverage. Through this tool kit,  
governments and experts will learn how to assess the existing legal, policy, and institutional framework; 
information and communication technology infrastructure;  and current use of identifiers relevant for the 
health sector, to inform policy decisions on advancing unique identification in the health sector.
