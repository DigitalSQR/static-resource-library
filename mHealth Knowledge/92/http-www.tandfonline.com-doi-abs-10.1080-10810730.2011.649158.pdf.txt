Abstract
While	mHealth	has	the	potential	to	overcome	traditional	obstacles	to	the	delivery	of	health	services	to	the	poor	in
lower	and	middle-income	countries—issues	related	to	access,	quality,	time,	and	resources—there	is	little	evidence	as
to	whether	the	expected	benefits	and	savings	can	be	actualized	on	a	large	scale.	As	a	first	step	to	developing	the
investment	case	for	mHealth,	this	article	outlines	some	of	the	key	economic	and	financial	questions	that	need	to	be
answered	in	developing	in-country	eHealth	investments.	The	proposed	questions	focus	on	the	costs	of	eHealth
infrastructure;	regulatory	structures	that	provide	incentives	at	different	levels	of	the	health	delivery	system	to
encourage	investment	in,	and	use	of,	eHealth;	and	measuring	the	outcomes	of	successful	eHealth	utilization,	including
anticipated	return	on	investment.
