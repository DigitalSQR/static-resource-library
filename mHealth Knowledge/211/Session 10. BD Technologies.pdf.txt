Smart Devices Supporting Software
Example: UAVs for “On-demand Healthcare”
1. Understand the unmet needs
2. Develop network of partners
3. Identify public-private partnership 
opportunities
4. Solution development and 
iteration, 1st Objective of pilot 
study
Opportunities for Collaboration
1. Collaborate on work currently in progress
A) Pilot studies of ready-to-test technologies
• Vaccine and medication delivery by UAV
B) Co-development of early stage / front-end 
technologies
• Improving immunization yield through RFID and 
smart drug delivery devices
2. Dialogue on new areas for development
• Improving compliance to therapy regimens (e.g. 
diabetes)
