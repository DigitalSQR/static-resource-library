ABOUT iHRIS AND THE MOBILE 
REFERENCE DICTIONARY 
The iHRIS system consists of electronic databases for 
storing information, software for entering and 
updating data and reporting, and analysis tools.  iHRIS 
databases have been established at various institutions 
including four health professional councils. The 
districts can access and use professional council 
databases to verify registration and licenses of 
applicants, essentially screening applicants and thus 
identifying forgery cases and health workers who are 
not in good standing with the professional councils. 
The data from iHRIS databases is also used to verify 
payroll data to eliminate ghost workers.
