relations in developing countries: a systematic
literature review
Larissa Jennings1* and Laina Gagliardi2Abstract
Introduction: Research has shown that mHealth initiatives, or health programs enhanced by mobile phone
technologies, can foster women’s empowerment. Yet, there is growing concern that mobile-based programs
geared towards women may exacerbate gender inequalities.
Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the empirical evidence of changes in men and
women’s interactions as a result of mHealth interventions. To be eligible, studies had to have been published in
English from 2002 to 2012, conducted in a developing country, included an evaluation of a mobile health
intervention, and presented findings on resultant dynamics between women and men. The search strategy
comprised four electronic bibliographic databases in addition to a manual review of the reference lists of relevant
articles and a review of organizational websites and journals with recent mHealth publications. The methodological
rigor of selected studies was appraised by two independent reviewers who also abstracted data on the study’s
characteristics. Iterative thematic analyses were used to synthesize findings relating to gender-transformative and
non-transformative experiences.
Results: Out of the 173 articles retrieved for review, seven articles met the inclusion criteria and were retained in
the final analysis. Most mHealth interventions were SMS-based and conducted in sub-Saharan Africa on topics
relating to HIV/AIDS, sexual and reproductive health, health-based microenterprise, and non-communicable
diseases. Several methodological limitations were identified among eligible quantitative and qualitative studies. The
current literature suggests that mobile phone programs can influence gender relations in meaningfully positive
ways by providing new modes for couple’s health communication and cooperation and by enabling greater male
participation in health areas typically targeted towards women. MHealth initiatives also increased women’s decision-
making, social status, and access to health resources. However, programmatic experiences by design may
inadvertently reinforce the digital divide, and perpetuate existing gender-based power imbalances. Domestic
disputes and lack of spousal approval additionally hampered women’s participation.
Conclusion: Efforts to scale-up health interventions enhanced by mobile technologies should consider the
implementation and evaluation imperative of ensuring that mHealth programs transform rather than reinforce
gender inequalities. The evidence base on the effect of mHealth interventions on gender relations is weak, and
rigorous research is urgently needed.

http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/12/1/85Introduction
The gender divide in access to and use of mobile phone
technologies is well known [1-5]. Strategies around the
globe have aimed to improve women’s eligibility to partici-
pate in mHealth initiatives, or health programs enhanced
by mobile phone technologies, by targeting women’s bar-
riers to own and use mobile phones [1,2].
However, despite evidence on the positive effects of
mHealth interventions on women’s health and care-seeking,
there is growing concern that mobile-based programs
geared towards women may exacerbate gender inequal-
ities. Particularly in settings where men have historically
limited women’s autonomy and decision-making, little is
known regarding the full impact of mHealth programs on
the relational experiences of men and women [6,7].
Evidence suggests that while mHealth programs hold
the potential to shift gender roles by empowering women
through improvements in knowledge, decision-making, and
economic gain [8,9], some mHealth interventions may
exacerbate gender inequalities by reinforcing existing power
differentials [10-12]. For example, mHealth projects which
target female mobile phone owners or provide mobile
phones to women may have harmful consequences within
conjugal relationships brought on by women’s mobile-
enhanced autonomy and decision-making ability [1,13].
Such changes may increase women’s risk of domestic vio-
lence and privacy invasion, in addition to increasing men’s
monitoring of women’s whereabouts and communication.
Shifts in household spending due to increased mobile
airtime expenses may also aggravate existing household
dynamics.
The term, gender relations, refers to “varying roles and
relations between women and men which are influenced
by socio-cultural, political, economic, religious, and envir-
onmental factors” [13]. Recent discourse has highlighted a
growing need to develop “gender-transformative” initiatives
that promote relational equality rather than implement
programs which accommodate or ignore gender im-
balances by doing little to address them [14]. There are
concerns likewise regarding the implementation of “gen-
der-exploitative” programs which inadvertently rely on
power differences to achieve intervention goals [14]. Yet,
despite the need to develop appropriately empowering and
safe mobile health programs for women, there has been no
systematic review to-date to examine what is currently
known on the effect mHealth initiatives on gender rela-
tions in developing countries [10,15]. While understanding
the technology-gender relationship has been a growing
area of research [11,13,16], many studies have focused on
what Silverstone, Hirsch, and Morley (1992) refer to as ap-
propriation, or gendered access and ownership of techno-
logical resources, with less attention to incorporation or the
influences of technology on gender power relations [17].
This represents an important research gap regarding theprogrammatic effects on women’s relational experiences,
especially in settings where women must overcome social,
financial, and device literacy barriers, including spousal dis-
approval, in order to take part in mHealth interventions
[1,2,10,18]. This review aimed to synthesize the empirical
evidence of changes in men and women’s interactions as a
result of participation in mHealth interventions [15,16].
Methods
Inclusion criteria
Research studies that met the following criteria were in-
cluded: (i) the study evaluated a mobile phone health
intervention or intervention aiming to improve women’s
mobile phone ownership and use; (ii) the study was
conducted in a developing country, defined on the basis of
the World Bank categories for low-income, lower-middle
income, or upper-middle income economies [19]; (iii) out-
comes or observations relating to gender relations were
reported; and (iv) the study was published in English be-
tween January 2002 and December 2012. Peer-reviewed
and gray literature evaluations of all types, including qua-
litative, formative, or process evaluations were eligible.
Exclusion criteria included non-English-language studies,
studies conducted in developed countries, unpublished
reports (such as dissertations or conference abstracts),
non-intervention studies, mHealth interventions targeting
health workers, or studies where mobile phones were used
for data collection rather than intervention purposes.
Search strategy
A preliminary literature search was conducted to identify
relevant search terms and guide the development of
study appraisal documents. The search strategy included
an electronic and manual search. The electronic search
was the primary means of identifying relevant studies
and comprised of four electronic bibliographic databases
of peer-reviewed literature: MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO,
SciVerse Scopus, and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE).
These databases were selected to cover a broad range of
disciplines, including medical and social science research.
The search terms included Boolean-paired key word sets
of synonyms and spelling variations (where applicable) re-
lating to mobile phones, maternal and child health-related
interventions, and gender relations [Table 1].
To obtain non-peer reviewed or gray literature, a man-
ual review of nine websites of key organizations within
the mHealth area was conducted: GSMA mWomen,
Mobile Active, mHealth Alliance, Knowledge for Health,
International Center for Research on Women, Women for
Women International, Mobiles for Education Alliance,
mHealth Info, and Health Unbound. The manual search
also included a review of articles published from 2010 to
2012 in eight priority journals relating to mHealth or
among which mHealth-related articles had recently

the relatively recent implementation of mHealth interven-
tions and based on the limited number of eligible studies
published before 2010 as identified in the electronic search.
Title, abstract, and article screening
Figure 1 illustrates the search and screening process.
Once the search terms were applied to the electronic
databases, an initial selection of potentially relevant cita-
tions was based on the screening of the title and abstract
by the primary reviewer. Given that the title and abstract
did not provide sufficient information to determine eligi-
bility, the full-text publications of all potentially relevant
citations were acquired and skimmed by two reviewers

the retrieval process. Discrepancies in study eligibility
from the initial skim were discussed and corrected based
on consensus between the two reviewers. A second,
more thorough reading of selected studies was used to
determine, based on consensus, the final set of studies
retained for the review.
Study appraisal
All final selected studies underwent a systematic appraisal
by the two reviewers [Table 2]. Data were extracted and

and qualitative checklists. Inclusion of items for the quality
assessments was informed by published guidelines and
indexes for examining the quality of quantitative [20-24]
and qualitative studies [24-27]. The checklist for quantita-
tive studies used 11 items to evaluate the study’s methodo-
logical quality: longitudinal/prospective design; pre-post
measure of the outcome(s) of interest; use of control
or comparison group; comparison group selected from a
similar population with regard to pre-intervention out-
comes or socio-demographics; justified sample size; random
assignment of individuals to the intervention group; out-
come(s) of interest measured objectively; response or
follow-up rate of more than 80%; use of theoretical frame-
work; report of an index of variability (such as an estimate
of variance, confidence interval, or other test statistic); andreport of program implementation detail sufficient for repli-
cation. The 11 items were scored as 0 (=not found) or 1
(=found) and summed for a total of 11 points possible.
Based on the total quality score, each study was categorized
within one of three ratings: weak rating (less than or equal
to 5 points), moderate rating (6 to 8 points), and strong
rating (9 to 11 points).
The checklist for qualitative studies used 10 items to
evaluate the study’s methodological quality. The rigor
items used were: prolonged engagement in study setting;
justification for design and methods selected; sampling
strategy justified; analytical methods clearly described; use
of verification methods; reflexivity of account provided;
detailed report of findings; balanced and fair representa-
tion; conclusions supported and confirmed by the data;
and report of intervention implementation detail sufficient

http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/12/1/85for replication. The 10 items were scored similarly as the
quantitative index with less than or equal to 4 points
representing a weak rating, 5 to 7 points representing a
moderate rating, and 8 to 10 points representing a strong
rating. For mixed methods studies, separate quality ratings
were calculated for the qualitative and quantitative me-
thods presented in the article. Non-applicable assignments
were not allowed for items in either of the quality indexes.
Similar to the appraisal process, the quality scores were
determined independently by both reviewers and then
compared. Score discrepancies were resolved through
discussion. In most cases, the reviewers agreed on study
appraisal and quality assessment determinations.
Synthesis process
Findings and implications related to the influence of
mHealth interventions on gender relations were synthe-
sized using a thematic approach. This is commonly used
to summarize themes identified in systematic literature
reviews of qualitative and quantitative studies [28-30].
Similar to the analysis of textual data, the process of
synthesizing findings among selected articles comprised
an initial round of article memoing in which the reviewers
independently documented analytical interpretations of
findings to capture emerging themes [31,32]. Each article
was then read several times to extract and group related
results. We present findings related to two themes identi-
fied from the synthesis process and as discussed in the
growing body of literature on mHealth and gender. The
first theme relates to transformative influences on gender
relations, representing positive relational changes which
empower women as well as negative relational changes
brought by gender-based tensions [11,13,16,33]. The sec-
ond theme relates to non-transformative influences on
gender relations, representing ways in which participation
in mobile health interventions perpetuate rather than
challenge gendered-based inequalities [11,12,16,34].
Results
Literature search and review process
A total 173 full-text publications were retrieved for review
from 11,948 potentially relevant citations based on the
publication’s title and abstract (Figure 1). The retrieved
full-text articles were skimmed for eligibility, and 163 were
excluded. The most common reasons for exclusion were
absence of an evaluation of a mHealth intervention, study
location in a developed country, or absence of reported
findings on gender relations. Following a full and thorough
screening, 3 papers were additionally excluded due to
insufficient information.
Characteristics of included studies
Seven studies were retained in the final group of articles:
Akinfaderin-Agarau et al. [35], Balasubramanian et al.[36], Chib et al. [37], Corker [38], L’Engle et al. [39],
Misraghosh et al. [40], and Odigie et al. [41]. The majority
of selected articles were pulled from the electronic data-
base search with the exception of two which were identi-
fied from the manual search of reference lists and related
websites. Six studies were drawn from peer-reviewed
journals and one was identified from the gray literature.
The characteristics of the final set of articles are presented
in Table 2. Although the search examined articles from
2002 to 2012, all seven were published between 2010 and
2012. Five studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa
and two in South Asia. Several health areas were targeted
using mobile phone programs, including HIV/AIDS, sex-
ual and reproductive health, health-linked microenter-
prise, and non-communicable diseases. The majority of
mHealth interventions consisted of SMS-based programs
using interactive, quiz, and question-and-answer formats.
Others were call-based interventions where participants
received audio messages, accessed a hotline, or were ad-
vised to call physicians for medical counseling. A final
intervention utilized female mobile phone retailers to
increase women’s mobile phone uptake and literacy in
addition to providing mobile-based health information. All
mHealth interventions were evaluated using a single group
pre-and-post or posttest only design.
Quality of the evidence
Table 3 summarizes the quality assessment of the se-
lected articles. Four articles used quantitative research
methods, one used qualitative research methods, and
two used mixed methods. Among the six studies using
quantitative research methods (n=4 quantitative only
and n=2 mixed methods), two were rated as moderate
(6 to 8 points) and four were rated as weak (≤ 5 points).
Among the three studies using qualitative research
methods (n=1 qualitative only and n=2 mixed methods),
all three received moderate ratings (5 to 7 points). None
of the studies were judged to be of strong methodo-
logical quality. For studies with weak ratings, we did not
exclude them on the sole basis of methodological rigor
given the dearth of evidence on the influence of mHealth
interventions on gender relations, and the need to sum-
marize preliminary findings. This is often recommended
for low-rated studies with no critical measurement or
analytical deficiencies [42].
The most common strengths of the quantitative stud-
ies were longitudinal follow-up of users over time with
high response rates and descriptive intervention detail.
Common strengths of qualitative studies were justifi-
cation for selected methods and confirmable findings
based on detailed presentations of narratives and quotes.
Common weaknesses of qualitative studies related to
information on how study participants were sampled
and how narrative data were analyzed and verified.

or index of variability was often omitted in quantitative
studies.
Measuring influence on gender relations
Two of the selected studies included gender relations from
the outset as part of the evaluation aim. For the remaining
five articles, findings relating to gender relations emerged
over the course of the program or during the evaluation.
Methods to examine influences on gender relations in-
cluded focus group discussions, surveys, case studies, and
secondary analyses of mobile phone queries and quiz re-
sponses. With the exception of mobile usage analyses, all
studies examined influences of the mHealth interventions
on gender relations through direct reports from women.
No assessments included direct perspectives from male
spousal or sexual partners. The majority of studies re-
ported short-term findings relating to gender dynamics
within mHealth interventions, rather than examining
changes over time.
Transformative influences on gender relations
The current mHealth literature described several positive
transformations in the interaction of men and women.
One finding was that the provision of mobile-based health
information empowered couples to discuss health matters
that were traditionally addressed in women-only clinical
settings. Using post-intervention mobile queries, L’Engle
et al. [39] suggested that a free and anonymous interactive
short message service (SMS) portal in Tanzania created a
new channel for men to access information on family
planning methods in ways which did not require lengthy
waits and fees at the health facility. The portal provided
information on a range of family planning methods, in-
cluding side effects, method effectiveness, and duration of
use. Men represented almost half of the users (44%) and
queried about the same number of contraceptive measures
with 2.5 versus 2.1 queries compared to women, respect-
ively [39]. L’Engle and colleagues reported that men inves-
tigated contraceptive methods for themselves as well as
their female partners, suggesting greater communication
among couples. Using call data from the Democratic Re-
public of Congo, Corker [38] also attributed men’s calling
into a family planning hotline on behalf of their partners
as being a positive change in gender norms in a setting
where men are less likely than women to seek out health
care. The authors concluded that the intervention pro-
vided a new means for men to inquire about family plan-
ning and circumvented gender norms which limited their
attendance at health facilities. Such active information-
gathering by men was thought to reflect increases in
health-related cooperation among couples.
The literature also showed that mHealth interventions
can increase women’s autonomy in seeking healthinformation and services. Using post-intervention inter-
views, Odigie et al. [41] noted that a mobile-based phys-
ician dial-in service for women cancer patients in
Nigeria increased women’s ability to directly access
health care providers without relying on spousal permis-
sion or financial support for travel. The authors viewed
this as dramatically altering women’s traditional lines of
communication with health providers in ways that were
independent from spousal control. However, the study
did not examine resultant tensions, if any, among cou-
ples or the extent to which women relied on male part-
ners for use of phones.
A third finding suggests that mHealth projects that
supply women with mobile products, skills, or informa-
tion valued by men can shift control of household re-
sources and elevate the status of women. In rural India,
Balasubramanian et al. [36] found that registering program-
distributed mobile phones in women’s names meant
women were more likely to be recognized by households
as the phone’s owner [36]. Women entrepreneurs who
were enrolled in the intervention received mobile audio
messages across a range of health topics in addition to
business-related information on goat-rearing. In focus
groups, women reported that male household members
would seek permission to use the phone, a dramatic shift
from prior gender norms. Balasubramanian and colleagues
also noted that women’s increased knowledge on goat-
rearing from mobile audio messages raised their import-
ance as a member of the household [36]. Also in India,
to reduce the mobile phone gender gap, Misraghosh
et al. [40] found among qualitative case studies coupled
with sales data that engaging women to sell and distribute
mobile phone products with health-related added services
led to increased social empowerment and earning cap-
acity. Some women reported positive responses from male
spouses who also joined the mobile retail business, shifting
prior male roles as the sole breadwinner for the household
[40].
Non-transformative influences on gender relations
Other findings demonstrated the potential of mHealth
interventions to aggravate existing household dynamics.
Balasubramanian et al. [36] found that in some cases gen-
der hierarchies required rural Indian women to render
phones provided by the program to their male spouse if
he did not already own a phone. In these settings, women’s
ownership and use of the phone was viewed unfavorably
by spouses who traditionally controlled household re-
sources. Further conflicts between couples arose as well in
negotiating the use of project phones for women’s inter-
vention purposes (such as enterprise and health informa-
tion) versus communication purposes for men. Cases
studies conducted by Misraghosh et al. [40] add-
itionally described reports of spousal abuse by some
Jennings and Gagliardi International Journal for Equity in Health 2013, 12:85 Page 8 of 10
http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/12/1/85women mobile phone retailers whose participation in the
intervention challenged expectations of appropriate activ-
ities for women. Spousal demands for control and lack
of spousal support resulted in some women abandoning
the mobile program altogether. The authors noted that
this limited their ability to take full advantage of the in-
come generation and mobile-added health and financial
services.
The evidence pointed likewise to mHealth program ef-
fects which reinforced prior relational practices, including
women’s dependence on men for approval, technical, or
financial support. In Nigeria, Odigie et al. [41] found that
while an SMS cancer-treatment reminder and hotline
intervention enabled women to rely less on spousal
permission and financial support for care-seeking, the
women’s husbands often assumed the role of speaking
with the physician and arranging follow-up visits. Inter-
views with women attributed this to men’s role as the pri-
mary decision-maker of the household [41]. In some cases
as well, Balasubramanian et al. [36] noted that participa-
tion in the intervention required phone literacy which the
program implementers addressed during group trainings
on how to use a mobile phone. However, survey data
showed that nearly half (42%) of the selected women
stated that they had to seek help from their spouse as a
result of device and textual literacy barriers [36].
Although not a direct measure of influences on gender
relations, several articles also discussed the unexpected
finding relating to men’s predominant uptake of mHealth
interventions which were targeted towards women. Chib
et al. [37] and Corker [38] noted that men were likely bet-
ter able to hear about, access, and pay for mobile interven-
tion components, reflecting current gender disparities in
access to mobile technologies. In Uganda, the introduction
of an SMS-based HIV/AIDS campaign providing inter-
active quizzes and rewards resulted in a two-fold higher
response rate among men as compared to women based
on post-intervention mobile quiz data [37]. And, in the
Congo, over 80% of callers into a family planning voice
hotline were men, although the intervention’s primary
target group was women of reproductive age [38]. The
interventions, while successful in reaching men, were in-
terpreted as entrenching rather than transforming gender-
based inequities despite potential positive shifts in couples’
interactions.
In addition, expectations regarding the appropriate
behavior of women shaped how and whether women
participated in the mHealth project. In this sense, the
literature suggested that mobile initiatives did little to
impact gender relations, but reflected them instead. In
Nigeria, Akinfaderin-Agarau et al. [35] attributed gen-
dered expectations of women that discouraged their being
“inquisitive” and seeking out sexual health information as
a key reason for the limited enrollment in the HIV/AIDSSMS portal, which was accessed significantly more often
by men [35]. In focus groups, women also stated that priv-
acy and confidentiality concerns relating to the platform’s
request for location, age, and address were reasons for
non-participation. Furthermore, in households where men
closely managed communication, lack of spousal permis-
sion or increased suspicion was also commonly mentioned.
Given such barriers to mHealth program involvement, the
authors concluded that use of mobile technologies for de-
livering health information in some settings resulted largely
in reinforcing inequitable power relations.Discussion
To our knowledge, this review is the first to-date to exam-
ine the current evidence on the effect of women’s partici-
pation in mHealth interventions on gender relations in
developing countries. Findings showed that while the gen-
der disparities in access to and use of mobile technologies
are well known, the rapidly growing literature on mHealth
interventions provides little information on the extent to
which such efforts have positively or negatively impacted
gender relations.
However, despite the limited available evidence, several
key findings emerged. The current literature suggests that
mobile phone programs can influence the interactions of
men and women in meaningfully positive ways by provid-
ing new modes for couple’s health communication and
cooperation and by enabling greater male participation in
health areas typically targeted towards women. The review
found as well that mobile health programs can increase
women’s autonomy in seeking health information and
services, and when coupled with economic-strengthening
activities can also elevate women’s status and resource
control. We did not find strong evidence of specific ad-
verse events such as domestic violence, mobile stalking,
privacy invasions, or distrust by male partners and com-
munity members. However, the limited number of ac-
counts in the available data may reflect lack of inquiry or
reporting of such cases. In contrast, the review clearly
demonstrated that mobile-based programs may inadvert-
ently reinforce the digital divide, particularly in terms of
access to information. The technology also has the poten-
tial to reflect the existing gendered context, rather than
enabling a new dynamic, with little to no influence on
gender relations. In some cases, it was unclear if changes
in men’s engagement translated into positive and equitable
outcomes for women, or represented new means for men
to expand control over women. Other instances of limited
influences on gender relations were women’s dependency
on men’s approval or assistance to use mobile devices.
Some unfavorable changes were also described such as
tensions between couples regarding who ultimately owned
the mobile phone and how it would be used.

http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/12/1/85This points to an important recognition that while
mHealth interventions can significantly improve women’s
health and well-being, the expectation that mobile health
programs will drastically alter gender inequities within
relationships deserves some scrutiny. Unless there is a
conscientious effort to design mHealth initiatives that pro-
mote equitable relationships between men and women,
the scale-up of some current programs may prove harmful
to women. At the same time, the literature on the influ-
ence of mHealth interventions on gender relations is re-
latively weak. While we identified positive and negative
outcomes, to some extent the evidence remains inconclu-
sive. Some selected studies reported that determining the
full extent of whether women’s involvement in the inter-
vention impacted gender structures was beyond the scope
of study, and only two articles purposed from the outset
of the evaluation to examine gender-based dynamics. In
addition, the majority of studies used a single group post-
test design which was unable to differentiate between
direct effects of the intervention, such as autonomy or em-
powerment, on gender relations versus the added value of
mobile technology itself. Thus, when coupled with the
overall insufficient quality of the evidence base, we found
that there was a scarcity of research purposefully investi-
gating this topic. Rigorous research that examines gender
relations either as a stand-alone study or embedded within
existing experimental mHealth trials is urgently needed.
Nonetheless, the commonality of findings across various
settings can assist in the development of appropriately
empowering and gender-transformative mobile health
programs. Experience has shown that current gender in-
equalities have weakened attempts to scale-up health and
development interventions [43]. This review demonstrates
that more careful planning and investigation of potential
gender implications prior to implementation would likely
be informative when coupled with rigorous program
evaluation methodologies. Although mhealth programs
are often considered inherently beneficial, we recommend
that future efforts assess the transformative and potentially
exploitative effects of mobile initiatives. Such is needed
not only from the perspective of women, but men and
community members as well.
Limitations
The findings of this review were subject to limitations.
Our analysis did not apply a tiered system to synthesize
results by rigor category given the small number of identi-
fied studies. In addition, the quality ratings often reflected
the methodological designs adopted for the primary out-
come of interest, rather than peripheral findings related to
gender relations. Given the role that socio-cultural factors
play in defining relations between men and women, the
interpretation of findings is also highly context-specific
and may not be generalizable to other settings. Finally, it ispossible that some studies were overlooked given that the
search was limited to articles published in English and
those which were available online. As a result, the findings
do not represent experiences drawn from unpublished
and non-English texts. However, among electronically ac-
cessible English-language studies, we applied a consider-
ably thorough and robust search strategy.
Conclusion
The scarcity and low quality of the literature on the effect
of mHealth interventions on gender relations urgently ne-
cessitates more rigorous research. Current findings suggest
that mobile interventions can beneficially influence gender
relations, while at the same time strain and reinforce
existing power imbalances. Given the increasing number of
health and development interventions delivered by mobile
technologies, more care should be taken to implement and
evaluate mHealth program that promote, rather than hin-
der gender equality.
