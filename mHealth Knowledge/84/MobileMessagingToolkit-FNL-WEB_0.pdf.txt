About this Toolkit
WHAT?
This toolkit provides information about currently available mobile messaging technology solutions, as well as 
things to consider when selecting a vendor and deploying a mobile health, or mHealth, campaign. It is meant 
to be used with other resources on project design, content development, and behavioral change communica-
tions, including Planning an Information Systems Project: A Toolkit for Public Health Managers.1 
WHO?
This toolkit is designed for mHealth project implementers looking to deploy mobile messaging campaigns to 
encourage healthy participant behaviors in low- and middle-income countries. Whether a project is in the ear-
ly design phase or preparing for implementation, this toolkit will help project implementers navigate through 
critical questions ensuring that the vendor of choice matches the goals and needs of the pilot project as well 
as the project at scale.
WHY?
The mobile technology marketplace is very dynamic. Not only is the technology evolving but so are the infra-
structure and politics around mobile communications. This toolkit looks to provide frameworks for evaluat-
ing the best solution for a mHealth project within this environment.

Introduction
There are more than a billion mobile devices in the world. Mobile devices are increasingly being used to reach 
under-served, low-income, or remote populations.2 We are seeing that mobile messaging can drive behavioral 
change.3 Once health program implementers have chosen to use the power of mobile devices to influence health 
behavior, the challenge then is selecting and applying the appropriate mobile technology to address a health 
problem so that there is an actual behavioral impact. Unfortunately, this is not as simple as selecting a vendor, up-
loading a few files, and pressing go. Being aware of the key considerations in choosing a mHealth application can 
help implementers avoid common pitfalls in information and communication technology projects. For example:
• What are the capabilities of your organization?
• W hat is the technology scope and scale you 
want to achieve? MAMA 
• What are the project requirements?

Information System Planning in Eight Steps
Before starting out, it is a good practice for any mHealth project to review the eight essential steps to planning an 
impactful information systems project, as outlined in Planning an Information Systems Project.
STEP 1. DEFINE OUTCOMES: How will a better information system benefit you? How should you define the 
scope? How will you measure success?
STEP 2. FORM YOUR TEAM: What skills and roles are required to bring your project to a satisfying outcome?
STEP 3. DEFINE WHAT YOUR SYSTEM NEEDS TO DO: How can you define your requirements for the system?
STEP 4. FIND THE RIGHT SOLUTION: Should you buy or build your system? Do you select an open-source or 
proprietary system? How do you evaluate different systems and select the best one?
STEP 5. SELECT THE RIGHT VENDORS: How do you make sure you select the best providers of technical 
services? 
STEP 6. ESTIMATE IMPLEMENTATION AND OPER ATING COSTS: How much will your project cost to pilot, 
scale up, and maintain?
STEP 7. CREATE AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: How long will it take to develop, pilot, and scale up?
STEP 8. UNDERSTAND AND MANAGE PROJECT RISKS: What can go wrong and how can you plan for that?
STEP 1 . DEFINE OUTCOMES
In implementing mHealth projects like those of the MAMA partnership, much of the groundwork on best 
practices, processes, and requirements have already been documented through the learning community.5 It 
is, however, still a good idea to get project leaders and advisors to agree on the scope and scale of a project so 
that appropriate requirements can be documented. In this toolkit, we focus on solutions and services for a 
messaging project that will initially deploy with 1,000 to 3,000 subscribers. However, these can be adapted to 
smaller and larger projects.

STEP 2 . FORM YOUR TEAM
In forming your project team, it is important to carry out a resource assessment to ensure you have both the 
critical in-country support and technological capacity and availability to develop (or configure), deploy, and 
operationalize a messaging platform. Critical questions to ask include: 
• Does the required staff exist internally? 
• Who will manage and maintain the platform and databases? 
• What sort of support will be provided to end users (e.g., call center, registration support)? 
• Where can the vendor provide the knowledge and skills needed? 
NOTE: We will assume that, because you are reading this toolkit, you will be adding an outside vendor to your 
team to provide the appropriate messaging platform technology.
STEP 3 . DEFINE REQUIREMENTS: WHAT DOES YOUR SYSTEM NEED TO DO? 
In this section, we will review some of the key considerations in defining requirements for a mobile messag-
ing program. We will look at the project itself, as well as the messaging platform.
OVERALL PROJECT 
PILOT TO SCALE: HOW LARGE WILL IT GET? 
It is essential to keep the intended scale of the project in mind when planning a pilot. The decisions made now 
should be made with scaling-up needs and processes in mind. For example, if you selected a platform that runs 
solely on a laptop computer and modem yet plan to scale up nationally, the conversion to a web-based applica-
tion and data centers of a mobile network operator (MNO) may be prohibitively costly and require a complete 
replacement of the underlying information system. However, if the program is only intended to scale up to a 
district or regional level, the laptop platform may be sufficient.
These are a few key questions to think about early 
in the design and development phases of a proposed LARGER SCALE 
mHealth pilot program: IMPLEMENTATIONS 
• A fter a successful pilot, is there support to 
scale up the program? More integrated, full-service vendors such

SUBSCRIBERS: HOW MANY PARTICIPANTS WILL HAVE ACCESS? 
It is also important to understand the capacity of the target population to access and use mobile technology. 
For example:
• How many participants have mobile phones?
• What is the literacy rate?
• What is the market share of telecommunications companies in the targeted region?
• What is the local language? (If there is more than one, what proportion of participants uses each?)
MONITORING AND EVALUATION: HOW WILL IMPACT BE MEASURED?
Evidence on the success of any mHealth pilot vis-à-vis more traditional health programming should be an 
early design consideration. We recommend developing monitoring and evaluation (M&E) benchmarks and 
reporting requirements with input from key stakeholders, ensuring that they are a component of the overall 
health program’s M&E plan. This could be a simple Excel spreadsheet with registration and subscriber infor-
mation, more complex delivery receipt success/failure logs, or a reporting system that is integrated with exist-
ing electronic health (eHealth) platforms so that mothers’ clinic visits can be cross-referenced with messaging 
reminders as part of overall project reporting. 
CONTENT DEVELOPMENT AND LANGUAGE SUPPORT: WHAT IS THE LOCALIZATION PLAN?
Establish a plan to translate and/or adapt the messages to the appropriate delivery tone and voice for your 
subscribers. If you plan to record voice messages, identify the messages and type of persona or actor (voice, 
tone, etc.) that will have the greatest positive effect on behavior given the cultural context. You will also want 
to develop a messaging distribution schedule tied to key events. 
COUNTRY HOSTING REQUIREMENTS: WHERE WILL THE DATA BE STORED?
It is important to understand the data policies and regulations in the context where you will operate when 
considering where to store the data that you collect via mobile messaging. Keeping health care and patient 
data private is a major concern. See Table 1 for information on hosting options and important questions to 
consider regarding each of them.

MESSAGING PLATFORM REQUIREMENTS
LITER ACY AND LANGUAGE: WRITTEN OR VOICE MESSAGING? 
As we noted before, it is important to assess the literacy and language of the target population, or subscribers, 
early. This information will be essential to help you decide whether written (short message service, or SMS) 
or voice messaging (interactive voice response, or IVR) is most appropriate for your project. Table 2 compares 
the two systems.
• I nteractive voice response or IVR is an auto-

Platform Can support multiple languages Can support multiple languages
Note: IVR, interactive voice response; SMS, short message service.
ADDITIONAL CONTENT OR INTER ACTIVITY: ARE THEY NEEDED?
In addition, to basic text or voice messaging you also might want to send pictures or videos, or provide a 
callback or interactive service.
•  Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) is a protocol that creates a real-time open 
connection between a global system for mobile (GSM) communications and a remote service, which 
allows it to be more responsive than SMS. This protocol can be also be used to provide callbacks.
•  Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is a protocol that allows for rich content, such as pictures or 
videos, to be sent to and from mobile phones.
REGISTR ATION: WHAT IS THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS? 
Establish how subscribers will enroll or register with the program by considering the following questions: 
• Will registration be via SMS or IVR? 
• Does the platform need to offer online/web registration capabilities? 
• Will you use community health workers to register mothers in person or at a clinic?
mHealth Mobile Messaging Toolkit | 5
• Will subscribers register on their own via their own mobile devices?
• What questions will be asked upon registration?
NOTE: These same questions should be asked in regard to opt out processes.
OUTREACH: HOW WILL PARTICIPATION BE ENCOUR AGED?
It is not enough for the government or an organization to think that a mobile messaging project is needed; 
there needs to be demand or obvious benefits for the subscribers to join. A marketing plan and budget 
should be agreed upon for a pilot implementation as well as for a larger scale implementation, which should 
take into consideration:
• How will subscribers become aware of the service? 
• Will media (print, radio, etc.) be used to create interest? 
• What plan is there to reach the targeted number of subscribers for a pilot?
TIP: The MAMA website at www.mobilemamaalliance.org has great resources to help convey the value and 
benefits to mothers of enrolling in a program. 
SHORT CODES: DO YOU NEED ONE? 
Short codes are special telephone numbers, typically SOME VENDORS OFFERING 
four to six characters long, that can be used to send ASSISTANCE SECURING 
and receive SMS messages (e.g., text “join” to 55333 to SHORT CODES:
enroll). Custom short codes may be available in cer-
tain networks, and it is also possible to share a short • engageSPARK

• VOTO Mobile
•  Drawbacks: may be expensive and/or 
time-consuming to set up.
CUSTOMER SUPPORT: HOW WILL HELP BE PROVIDED? 
You also want to think about how subscribers will get help if they have a problem—either with the technology 
or with health-related issues. Some questions to answer include:
•  Is two-way mobile messaging communication 
part of the program? 
• I s the program going to offer support services FLASHING
such as a helpline or the ability to request a call 
back via SMS? What hours will it be staffed Flashing is a method of communication used 
(e.g., on weekends or when clinics are closed)? in several low-resource countries in which a

This is an important question related to the number 
of subscribers the project is targeting. Details are provided below and a summary is provided in Figure 1.
• D irect to mobile: Smaller programs and proof-of-concept pilots (less than 1,000 subscribers)may only 
need a platform that supports a very simple GSM modem or subscriber identification module (SIM) 
card to send SMS messages from a mobile device (typically an Android phone). This can be quick to 
deploy and is a simple form of communicating with subscribers. Scaling up can be done by adding 
SIM cards or devices or by switching to a direct-to-SMS gateway or aggregator. Vendors often allow for 
trials with their platforms, and can also assist with scaling.
6 | mHealth Mobile Messaging Toolkit
S imple GSM modem options are generally not recommended for large-scale projects because they 
cannot handle higher message volumes. The technology only allows for one SMS to be sent every 6 
seconds, which can cause a bottleneck if multiple messages need to be delivered to subscribers at a 
specific time of day. 
SERVICE-LEVEL AGREEMENTS
Service-level agreements are agreements between two parties that define the level(s) of service being 
sold or agreed upon . For mobile messaging, this can refer to network availability, on-time transmission 
delivery, system monitoring, among others . Some vendors offer service-level agreements to custom-
ers, while others may pass along mobile network operator service-level agreements to their customers 
in their contracts .
• S MS gateways, aggregators, and MNOs: SMS gateways and aggregators are third parties that enable 
the transmission of bulk messages to subscribers through an interface or platform that works with 
multiple MNOs. 
–  An SMS gateway is a website that allows SMS messages to be sent via computer by establishing 
connections across various operators’ communication protocols. 
–  Aggregators make use of established gateways and provide services such as help managing the 
delivery and receipt of messages, reporting, as well as volume discounts for transmission rates.
–  MNOs are the actual telephone companies that own the networks that the messages are transmitted 
across. Multiple MNOs may exist in each location, each with a slightly different messaging protocol. 
Understanding the mobile landscape and number of MNOs in existence as well as their coverage of 
your targeted subscribers will help determine whether you should use an aggregator. The good news 
is that many vendors have strong existing relationships with aggregators and MNOs.

INTEGRATE WITH EXISTING EHEALTH SYSTEMS: YES OR NO?
As mentioned in the M&E section, you will want to identify if there are other eHealth systems that your system 
can integrate with for purposes of data collection and reporting. If so, you will need to establish common stan-
dards to facilitate this information sharing. Table 3 provides some questions to help you navigate this process.
Table 3. eHealth M&E platform integration checklist.
Yes/No Sample questions
 Is there an existing national eHealth system in place?
Does the eHealth platform allow for inter-operability with other systems?
• Are there data standards?
•  Is there capacity and knowledge within the team to extract and interro-
gate the data from the eHealth system?
Is needed data readily accessible?
•  Are mother/child unique identification numbers/registration numbers 
included?
• Is the mobile phone number attached to the record?
• Is there an existing prenatal visit schedule?
• Can the system track health center or clinic visits/no-shows?
• Does the system include vaccination schedules for newborns?
• Can vaccination records and dates be extracted?
 Can data be cross-referenced with the mHealth messaging platform? 
What are the standards for M&E metrics?
Note: eHealth, electronic health; M&E, monitoring and evaluation; mHealth, mobile health.

STEPS 4 AND 5 . FIND THE RIGHT SOLUTION AND VENDOR
Now that you have defined your requirements, you can start looking for a vendor who can build the appro-
priate (or apply an existing) mobile messaging application for your project. It can be helpful to complete the 
vendor requirement checklist (Table 4) so you have a summary of what you are looking for.
Once you have shortlisted your prospective vendors, it is a good idea to ask for a demonstration of the pro-
posed solution. You want to evaluate the vendor as a potential partner, as well as whether the technology is a 
good match for your project. Some exploratory questions to ask include:
• What do I need to know about your solution/company?
• Do you understand our project? Why are you the best solution and partner for the project?
•  How easy is the technology to configure and use? Will we require training? If yes, how will it be provided?
• What resources do you have to manage and maintain the system? What are the costs for these resources?
•  Will we need customization or is your “out of the box” solution sufficient for our needs? What are the 
costs for customization/development as well as the ongoing maintenance of these customizations? 
• H ow will your solution scale up (to regional and national levels)? What are the conversion costs? What 
is the cost of the network bandwidth, data storage, and hardware? Any economies of scale as messag-
ing volume increases? 
• How will the collected data be presented? How will it be stored?
• What have the main obstacles been for implementing projects in the past?
• W hat is your largest implementation example? What is an example of an implementation that you are 
most proud of or had the most impact? Can you provide references?

STEP 6 . ESTIMATE IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATING COSTS
The next step is to estimate the total cost of ownership for the project. Be sure to include all three phases of the 
project: design/development, deployment, and operations, as well as general management and overhead costs 
(see Table 5). Questions to consider include the following:
• What are the daily maintenance and operation costs? 
• What are the transmission costs and platform fees?
• Are there hardware maintenance costs, rental fees, or equipment depreciation? 
• How many hours a day are needed to maintain the system? 
• Does the platform require a full-time employee? More than one? 
FIXED VS. VARIABLE COSTS: FINDING ECONOMIES OF SCALE
Variable costs are costs that increase or decrease with a change in volume or usage . In the context 
of a mobile messaging solution, the most common variable cost is the messaging itself . Typically, 
SMS and IVR messages are billed on a per-message or per-minute basis . Therefore, as the quantity 
of messages increases, so does the cost of messaging . Likewise, if more advanced messaging 
like MMS or USSD is used, data usage will typically have a linear relationship with the data rates . 
These costs and rates should be known in advance via your contract with the partner or aggrega-
tor so that they can be modeled before deploying the solution . 
Understanding which costs are variable helps in understanding where efficiencies and economies of 
scale can be made in the financial model . If the solution is able to increase the efficiency of the human 
resources needed (e .g ., message more mothers/subscribers with the same number of staff), the solu-
tion will be generating efficiencies .

STEPS 7 AND 8 . CREATE AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND UNDERSTAND 
AND MANAGE PROJECT RISKS
You are almost finished with your project planning! Before you start implementation, work through a few 
final tasks:
• Establish milestones and deliverables with your new partner vendor.
• Set a realistic development schedule.
• Establish a risk management plan.
• Develop and sign off on a written scope of work with your vendor to avoid scope creep or delays.
See the additional resources in the following sections for templates and tools that provide additional example 
schedules and methods for managing risks.
TOOLBOX
•  Appendices E, F, and G contain budgeting worksheets to help you calculate the cost of the 
total project, as well as annual and per subscriber messaging costs . Be sure to complete the 
worksheets for your pilot, as well as a fully scaled project .

MESSAGING COST CALCULATOR INSTRUCTIONS
• To begin, complete the orange-shaded boxes with the appropriate data for your project. 
•  There are two columns, one for a Pilot and another for running the project @ Scale (regional or 
national level). Calculations can be done in parallel for each column if desired.
• After you have filled in the green boxes, perform the following calculations:
–  Line F:  Multiply Line D x Line E. Do you understand our project? Why are you the best solution 
and partner for the project?
–  This will provide the number of subscribers in the targeted population for which SMS is appropriate. 
If this number is sufficient, enter a “Yes” in the blue box. If more subscribers are needed for the study, 
enter “No.”
–  Line I:  If “No” was entered in Line G, multiply Line H x Line D to calculate the number of IVR 
subscribers.
–  Line F + Line I will be your total number of subscribers.
–  Line J:  SMS messages per week. Multiply the value in the green box by Line F to get the number 
of SMS messages to be sent per week.
–  Line K: IVR messages per week. Multiply the value in the green box by Line I to get the number of 
IVR messages to be sent per week.
– L ine L and Line M are the per message rate provided by the vendor, aggregator, or MNO. For 
the model, we assume the IVR rate is the charge for a 1-minute message; adjust according to the 
project’s average voice message length.
•  Now we are ready to calculate the costs per year. For pilot study years, use the values in the Pilot 
column. To calculate costs at scale, use the values in the @ Scale column. If the project is projecting 
growth year over year, adjust the variables in the green boxes to calculate each year as appropriate.
–  Line A:  Transmission costs (the cost to send messages to subscribers): 
Multiply Line J x Line L for the SMS weekly cost, then multiply by 52 for the number of weeks 
in the year. 
Multiply Line K x Line M for the IVR weekly cost, then multiply by 52 for the number of 
weeks in the year.
– Add the SMS and IVR costs together for the annual transmission costs.
– L ine B: If a short code is being used for the program, add Line N + Line A for the total messaging 
costs.
–  Line C:  Cost per subscriber. Divide Line B by the sum of Line F + Line I for the total cost per 
subscriber.
– F inally, input the calculated values from Line B for each year in the total cost of ownership budget 
matrix (Appendix E).
