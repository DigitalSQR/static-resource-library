ZIMBABWE April 2019
Snapshot of the Strength of the Health Information System 
as a Source of HIV Data
Health information systems (HIS) are important tools 
in combatting the HIV epidemic, from the individual to 
the population level. Electronic health records contain 
individual patient information that helps clinicians provide 
high-quality care and can improve continuity of  care across 
services and institutions. Laboratory information systems 
improve the submission of  lab tests and the receipt of  
results. Logistic information systems can help forecast the 
need for medications and other commodities and reduce 
stockouts of  antiretroviral drugs and other medications. 
Routine health information systems are used to compile 
this information for reports from facilities to the national 
level. Data use at all levels of  the health system is necessary 
to monitor coverage of  HIV interventions and progress 
toward targets. And finally, population-level surveys 
provide information on changes in behavior and HIV 
prevalence every few years; these data are needed to assess 
the impact of  HIV programs over time.

According to the 2005/2006, 2010/2011, and 2015 of  2015–2016 found that, of  those living with HIV and on 
Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey reports, the ART, 86.5 percent were virally suppressed (87.9% of  women
