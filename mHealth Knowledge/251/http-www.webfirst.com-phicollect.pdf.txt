WebFirst’s Mobile Data Collection Solution
MOBILE	DATA	COLLECTION	SOLUTION
With	WebFirst’s	PhiCollect	system,	we	have	created	an	open	source	data	collection	platform	that	is	flexible,
scalable,	cloud-based,	and	affordable.	PhiCollect	allows	you	to	collect	data	from	and	publish	to	a	variety	of
platforms	(Web,	Android,	Apple	iOS,	SMS).	We	have	leveraged	two	existing,	well-established	platforms	in	the	design
of	our	system	-	Open	Data	Kit	(Android	App)	integrated	with	the	Drupal	(open	source)	framework.	We	can	also
configure	ODK	to	work	with	your	database!
With	PhiCollect,	mobile	health	researchers	can	analyze	data	more	effectively	and	communicate	with	each	other	in	a
more	effective	and	efficient	way,	furthering	mutual	goals	in	a	variety	of	fields	including:	public	health,	emergency
response,	food	security	and	facilities	management.	By	using	platforms	that	have	readily	available	modules,
important	functions	can	be	easily	added	at	relatively	low	cost.
Why	utilize	Drupal?
By	using	the	Drupal	framework,	we	can	leverage	all	of	the	forms,	permissions	and	contrib	modules,	helping	to
improve	data	management	and	analysis	by	utilizing	the	latest	techniques	and	methods.	For	example,	leveraging
3rd	party	machine	Learning	engines	and	data	visualization	packages	(e.g.	Tableau)	is	a	snap!
