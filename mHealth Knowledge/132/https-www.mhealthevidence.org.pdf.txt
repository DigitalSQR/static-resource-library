What	is	mHealth	Evidence?
mHealthEvidence.org	was	designed	to	bring	together	the	worldâ€™s	literature	on	mHealth	to	make	it	easier	for	program	managers,
researchers,	government	leaders,	donors,	software	developers,	and	other	key	decision-makers	to	quickly	get	up	to	speed	on	the	current
state-of-the-art	and	evidence-based	best	practices.	It	includes	peer-reviewed	and	grey	literature	from	low-,	middle-	and	high-resource
settings.

Factors	that	influence	the	implementation	of	e-health:	a	systematic	review	of	systematic	reviews.	This	review	provides	an
update	and	re-analysis	of	a	systematic	review	of	the	e-health	implementation	literature	culminating	in	a	set	of	accessible	and
usable	recommendations	for	anyone	involved	or	interested	in	the	implementation	of	e-health.
A	2017	study	from	the	Icahn	School	of	Medicine	at	Mount	Sinai 	demonstrates	that	conducting	some	studies	entirely	via
smartphones	is	feasible,	fruitful,	and	scalable:	It	stands	up	to	scientific	rigor,	allows	for	large-scale	participant	enrollment,	and
captures	unique	environmental	data	not	available	through	traditional	methods.
Guidelines	for	reporting	of	health	interventions	using	mobile	phones:	mobile	health	(mHealth)	evidence	reporting	and	assessment
(mERA)	checklist.	This	work	marks	the	culmination	of	three	years	of	multi-institutional	collaborations	to	determine	standards	for
reporting	digital	health	evidence.	The	authors	hope	that	the	systematic	use	of	this	checklist	to	report	research	findings	will	help
improve	the	quality	of	digital	health	evidence.
Mobile	Technology	in	Support	of	Frontline	Health	Workers:	A	comprehensive	overview	of	the	landscape,	knowledge	gaps	and
future	directions.	This	report	summarizes	current	data	from	over	140	FHW-supported	mHealth	projects	from	developing	countries
to	describe	the	emergent	trends	and	best	practices	in	the	use	of	mobile	phones,	tablets,	and	technical	platforms	by	FHWs	over
the	last	decade,	understand	the	key	considerations	in	choosing	the	type	of	phone	and	platform	and	associated	programmatic
costs,	present	the	evidence	on	the	effectiveness	of	mobile	approaches,	and	establish	a	framework	for	systematically	deploying
such	tools.
