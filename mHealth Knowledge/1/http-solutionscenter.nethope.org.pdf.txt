NETHOPE'S	NEW	NGO	GUIDE	TO	ENERGY	SOLUTIONS
International	NGO	Members	often	have	to	rely	on	diesel	fuel	and	harmful,	polluting	energy	sources	(e.g.,	diesel	and	wood)	to	power	many	of	their	field	office	operations.	Guided	by	the	principle	spelled	out	in	the	United
Nations	Sustainable	Development	Goal	(SDG)	#7:	Ensure	access	to	affordable,	reliable,	sustainable	and	modern	energy	for	all,	NetHope	members	are	inspired	to	identify	and	adopt	programs	that	increase	access	to
affordable	green	energy	solutions.	Learn	more	about	NetHope's	efforts	in	our	new	NGO	Guide	to	Energy	Solutions.
