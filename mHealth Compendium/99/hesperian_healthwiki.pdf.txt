HESPERIAN HEALTHWIKI
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  October 2011 to Present
Increasing access to mHealth and eHealth information in Africa
In most African nations, there is less than one physician per 1,000 people. Instead, community health 
workers (CHWs) are often the first line of defense against illness, and globally CHWs prevent a 
death once every three seconds.1,2 To build up the skills and capacities of primary health care systems, 
CHWs, and lay people, Hesperian Health Guides created the HealthWiki, an online source of clear, 
actionable, and thorough health information.3 With a lightweight, searchable format, the HealthWiki 
is accessible via computer or mobile device, and allows users to browse eight free volumes of health 
information on a range of topics, including family planning, early childhood development, first aid, 
noncommunicable diseases, environmental health, and disabilities. The HealthWiki has been online 
since October 2011 and has since been translated into 12 languages. By tracking the use patterns of 
users through Google Analytics, we may observe the health information-seeking behavior of end users 
to inform future content development and translation initiatives, and also compare the Pan-African 
health information-seeking behavior with global trends in HealthWiki use.
