Successes since Addis Ababa (1II)
• Selected Developments in mHealth:
– cStock – Scaled up to all Village Clinics in Mw
– Chipatala Cha Pa Foni (Health Center by Phone)
– mHealth Triage Intervention (ETAT)
– CBMNH & CCM 
– Facility IMCI
– Dial a Doctor
– SMART
– Mobile Order Entry Laboratory Information 
System
– DHIS Mobile
Challenges
• Network reliability: SMS messages that run through third 
party aggregators generally get deprioritized against 
person-person messages. This can lead to long message 
queues and delays.
• Lack of centralised/regional support for repair of devises 
such as computers, modems that are distributed and used 
across the country
• Lack of clear understanding of human resource capacity 
gaps at different levels including community health workers
• Misuse by some malicious users of the anonymous hotline
• Data use by recipients/decision makers is still limited and 
this demotivated the data collectors.
• Limited investment in measuring impact on health 
outcomes over all.
Lessons Learnt
• Government leadership is key in the alignment, scale up and 
sustainability of ehealth/mhealth initiatives
• Strengthening existing processes is often less disruptive, and is 
an easier entry point when introducing new technologies. 
Avoid introducing new processes, workflows or data collection 
needs
• There should be careful assessment of implications for 
additional training support, system management, repair and 
maintenance of devices and power (either solar or grid). 
• Surveillance data useful beyond just timely data. Example of 
CHW in Kotido - data showed increase in pneumonia cases. 
Surveillance team found VHTs were actually mis-diagonising 
the disease. Organized a refresher training.
LESSONS LEARNT
▪ Government buy-in is essential
▪ Political will is required
▪ Multi-stakeholder involvement 
is critical
▪ Intra-governmental synergy is 
mandatory
▪ Leveraging on existing data is 
fundamental
▪ Human capital development is a 
11
prerequisite
▪ R&D in mobile trends is  
indispensable
▪ Multiple MNO engagement is 
important

THE SOLUTION: mTrain
The development of a mobile phone-based 
learning application is to address these challenges.

How we use mobile money
• Transfer funds from D-tree to Community 
Health Worker (CHW) accounts
• CHW organizes transportation and pays 
drivers from account using mobile money
• CHW withdraws their incentive at end of 
month
• Audit transactions using application records, 
mobile money accounts and sign-in books at 
health facilities

Critical outcomes of the partnership model
• Improved access to and use of 
information for better planning, 
resource allocation and policy 
development
• Standardization of applications
• Avoidance of duplication
• Enhanced service delivery
• Readily available local technical 
support
         Improved  health outcomes
Where 
do we go from here?
Work together to strengthen country 
ownership and governance for Digital Health
Policies, strategies and regulatory 
frameworks
Strengthen basic building blocks
Enterprise architecture and data standards
Ensure interoperability of solutions
Human resources development
Strengthen human capacity for effectively managing 
Digital Health solutions at the country level
28
Work together to achieve economies of scale
Hardware
As digital devices become essential pieces of medical 
equipment, MOHs should be able to procure them 
through global channels
Software
Open-source software provides a leveraged return 
on investment, but requires support for the core
Services
By working with MNOs and other partners, services 
can be more rapidly scaled up within a country and 
scaled out to additional countries
 29
Work together to strengthen knowledge-
sharing and collaboration
Global Digital Health commons
Sites like mHealthKnowledge.org and 
mHealthEvidence.org
Country-level communities of practice
Digital Health working groups led by the MOH
Regional communities of practice
Regional networks like ANDH, HealthE Africa, Acfee

Work together to develop and implement a 
Digital Health learning agenda
Effectiveness at scale
Impact on access, quality and efficiency at scale
Cost-effectiveness
Compared to traditional approaches
Vertical health interventions
PMTCT, skilled birth attendance, etc.
Cross-cutting health systems interventions
Health finance, training and supervision, etc.
