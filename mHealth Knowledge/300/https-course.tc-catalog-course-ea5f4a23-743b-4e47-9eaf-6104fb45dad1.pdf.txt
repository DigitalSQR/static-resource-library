Technology	for	mapmaking	is	redefining	international	development.	In	this	four-week	online	course,	users	will
learn	from	leading	experts	how	to	leverage	open	data	in	OpenStreetMap,	make	beautiful	maps	in	MapBox,	map	a
crisis	in	Ushahidi,	and	manage	projects	with	Palantir	and	Tomnod.
Course	Description
How	can	you	better	visualize	the	geographic	impact	of	your	organization,	projects,	and	global	development
programs?	The	use	of	digital	mapping	tools	is	beginning	to	reshape	the	way	that	international	development
activities	are	carried	out.	Government	agencies,	NGOs,	companies,	and	other	actors	are	beginning	to	turn	to
digital	maps	to	draw	attention	to	human	rights	violations,	help	communities	prepare	for	natural	disasters,	visualize
social	media	trends	in	real-time,	monitor	election	violence,	distribute	food	and	other	resources	more	effectively
and	so	much	more.
In	this	course,	we	will	think	critically	about	geospatial	data	and	map	production	‘behind	the	scenes.’	We	will	also
look	at	case	studies	and	real-world	applications	of	maps	created	to	address	issues	surrounding	social	and
environmental	equity.	You’ll	be	introduced	to	a	number	of	topics,	such	as	how	crowdsourced	mapping	is
improving	patient	health	in	Ghana	and	the	way	visualizations	are	shifting	US	policies.
In	this	four-week	online	certificate	course,	participants	will	learn	practical	skills	related	to	all	aspects	of	the	map
creation	process:
(1)	How	to	gather	data	for	your	map	or	work	with	data	that	already	exists
(2)	How	to	organize	and	classify	data	effectively
(3)	How	to	design	an	aesthetically	beautiful	digital	map
(4)	How	to	maintain	the	map	over	time.	Some	of	the	platforms	and	tools	we	will	explore	include:	CartoDB,
OpenStreetMap,	GoogleMapMaker,	MapBox,	Ushahidi,	ArcGIS,	as	well	as	Palantir	and	CaerusGeo.
	
Participants	will	work	with	leading	experts	in	the	field	to	explore	topics	like	how	to	choose	the	right	mapping
platform,	how	to	create	a	narrative	or	story	with	a	map,	how	to	work	with	data	from	the	crowd	and	more.
Participants	can	expect	a	dynamic	learning	environment	with	a	number	of	real-world	case	studies	from	countries
like	Syria	and	Indonesia,	custom	animations	and	video	tutorials,	interactions	with	leading	experts	in	the	field	and
practical	simulations	to	apply	new	skills	and	strategies.
