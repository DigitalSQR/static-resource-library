Vision Statement



                                        
Empower the most vulnerable households and community health workers/volunteers through use of common, shared, multi-functional and collaboratively designed mobile health solutions to deliver community-based health interventions.
Principles for our Work:

Coherence and quality of approach and programe/project management
ALWAYS in partnership with others and building on global learning
Designed to meet the needs of community users but also provide the basis for maturing the evidence base
Initially affordable yet based on sustainable costing models and scalable technology
Considers data governance issues
Uses and strengthens government partners’ information systems 
Favors open source solutions and emerging global standards

National Level
District Level
Community Level

WV’s mHealth Vision Statement and related deployments focuses on the last mile – vulnerable communities and community health workers.  The principles behind our work focus on collaborative, common solutions that are designed iteratively with end users.

mHealth Theory of Change

CHW/V motivation & retention

More sustainable, effective and efficient CHW/V workforce
Referral closure rates between CHW/V and facilities
* i.e. ttC visit schedule or CCM clinical case management protocols
ICT System performance & scalability

KEY POINTS:
The goals are tied most closely to MDGs 4 and 5 but also contribute to some aspects of MDGs 1 (particularly nutritional status of pregnant women and children U5) and 6 (particularly HIV and malaria).
At the outcome level, we expect the “value add” of mHealth to be reflected in these 4 areas. These metrics would only be gathered periodically with the purpose of documenting quantifiable change at the population, CHW workforce or community level.
Immediate outcomes that would be tracked on an ongoing basis to both refine the application itself and document how the mHealth application has directly effected program beneficiaries. The information would either be sourced from standard M&E data tracked by the mobile application itself or by CHW supervisor records and the records kept by community-based structures that support the CHW program, for example, community health committees or advocacy groups. Strengthening community level structures is a central aspect of WV’s Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition strategy.
NOTE that adherence to case management protocols can contribute to both the first and second outcome listed here – adherence to the ttC visit schedule for example, would also strongly affect the first outcome. Similarly, appropriate and timely use of program monitoring information can reinforce CHW supportive supervision systems and thus support both the 3rd and final outcome listed here.
ICT system performance characteristics are hypothesized to have a direct impact on the efficiency of front line health care workers but system performance and its potential scalability also have a reinforcing effect on several other pathways leading to positive health outcomes.
We are in the process of developing an illustrative logical framework to propose appropriate indicators at both the output and outcome level.

mERA 

	Criteria	Description	Source	Gaps	
Item 1	Infrastructure (population level)	Describe, in detail, the necessary ICT infrastructure which was required to enable the operation of the mHealth programmme	Rapid Assessment Tool	Literacy rate - is typically available in WV programming context through routine baselining for programming. Would not be available among mHealth users/beneficiaries specifically.	
Item 2	Technology platform	Describe, in sufficient detail to allow replication of the work, the software and hardware combinations used in the programme implementation	Factsheets; Project Reports	Factsheets would provide basic description of technology platform and infrastructure but not sufficient detail to replicate (i.e. system configuration specifications)	
Item 3	Interoperability/Health Information systems (HIS) context	Describe how, if at all, the mHealth strategy connects to and interacts with national or regional Health Information Systems (HIS)/programme context	Factsheets; Rapid Assessment Tool; Project Reports	Factsheets can assess interoperability on a very basic level.

Project Reports would need to describe HMIS alignment efforts and negotiations towards achieving interoperability with MoH systems	



mERA 

	Criteria	Description	Source	Gaps	
Item 4	Intervention delivery	Elaborate the mode, frequency, and intensity (dose) of the mHealth intervention	Factsheets; Referral Closure	Factsheets would provide basic description of frequency, intensity, mode of delivery but again not in sufficient detail to replicate (i.e. alerts/reminders received by users; structure of BCC messaging; duration of messaging exposure, etc.)	
Item 5	Intervention content	Describe how the content was developed/identified and customised	Factsheets; Project Reports	Again factsheets would give high level info but project documentation expected to give greater depth (e.g Source for BCC messaging, process to contextualize etc)

	
Item 6	Usability/content testing	Describe how the end-users of the system engaged in the development of the intervention	Factsheets; Solution Provider Reports; User/Beneficiary Acceptability Tool	Again, high level description for factsheets would need to be augmented by project documentation info likely from solution provider. User acceptability can independently assess effectiveness of this component.	



mERA 

	Criteria	Description	Source	Gaps	
Item 7	User feedback	Describe user feedback about the intervention or user satisfaction with the intervention	User/Beneficiary Acceptability Tool	
	
Item 8	Access of individual participants	Mention barriers or facilitators to the adoption of the intervention among study participants	Rapid Assessment Tool;Post Training Assessment and Competency Assessmen; Project Reports	
	
Item 9	Cost assessment	Present basic costs of the mHealth intervention	Rapid Assessment Tool; Data Quality Assessment Tool	Rigorous cost-efficiency or cost-benefit analysis	
Item 10 	Adoption inputs/programme entry	Describe how people are informed about the programme or steps taken to support adoption	Post Training Assessment; Competency Assessment; Basic Training Event reports (facilitators, # participants, # classroom hrs, etc)	Quality and effectiveness of user support systems	



mERA 

	Criteria	Description	Source	Gaps	
Item 11	Limitations for delievery at scale	Present expected challenges for scaling up the intervention	Rapid Assessment Tool; Project Reports	Dimagi document describes ideal modus operandi. We need rich description of how it really happened on the ground. Again factsheets would give superficial picture.	
Item 12	Contextual adaptability	Describe appropriateness of the intervention to the context, and any possible adaptions	Factsheets;  Project Reports	Need a rich description of contextualization and language accommodations (comprehension field testing).	
Item 13	Replicability	Present adequate technical and content detail to support replicability	Full technical documentation available upon request. 	Alignment to HMIS and metrics to assess mHealth system performance	
Item 14	Data security	Describe security and confidentiality protocols	Factsheets

	Gather basic info via factsheet project. Probably sensible to identify projects that are furthest along and work together on a tool or checklist for documentation. This item is a required precursor for scalability (item 11).

	



mERA 

	Criteria	Description	Source	Gaps	
Item 15	Compliance with national guidelines or regulatory statutes	Assure that content or other guidance/information provided by the intervention is in alignment with existing national/regulatory guidelines and is described	Rapid Assessment Tool	Closely related to items 3, 11, 14. Need to develop a tool to assess progress towards compliance/alignment.	
Item 16	Fidelity of the intervention	Describe strategies employed to assess the fidelity of the intervention: assessment of participant engagement, use of backend data to track message delivery and other technological challenges in the delivery of the intervention	Post Training Assessment; system generated health/nutrition related output and intermediate outcomes; Project Reports	
	



Conclusions
Many mERA Checklist criteria can be readily and rigorously captured by the existing range of field-ready tools
Addressing some criteria heavily dependent on project reports which do not have standardized structure/content
Measurement gap areas need to be prioritized and simple standardized tools developed
Guidance regarding levels of evidence and corresponding scope of measurement needed
