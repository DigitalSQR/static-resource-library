This report reflects insights from a year-long community discussion of the Principles of Digital 
Development, during which over 500 individuals representing more than 100 organizations took part. 
Nine deep dive discussions generated community input on each Principle in detail. In addition to these 
nine Working Group meetings, presentations and side sessions about the Principles were organized at 
a variety of development industry events, including the CRS ICT4D conference, M&E Tech, and the 
mHealth Summit. Together, these events spanned cities including Accra, Baltimore, Helsinki, London, 
Nairobi, New York, San Francisco, and Washington.
This discussion paper was funded and managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development’s 
Global Development Lab, written by Adele Waugaman, and edited by Michael Dawson of FHI 360.

Foreword
Development is changing. One major reason why: technology is changing not just how we do business, but the 
model for development itself.
In developing countries and communities, digital technologies like the mobile phone are increasingly in the 
hands of  people who stand to benefit from them the most. This can mean increased access to services, like 
market price information for rural farmers, financial services for the previously unbanked, and maternal 
health messaging for pregnant women who live beyond the reach of  doctors or even health clinics. 
While the potential is clear, the success of  the thousands of  projects that have sprung up using technology 
to close access gaps is less so. Pilots have failed to move into scalable and sustainable programs. Solutions 
too often reinvent the wheel rather than building on robust platforms, infrastructure, and shared services. 
Applications and services designed thousands of  miles from their use environment failed to meet user needs. 
The creation of  duplicative tools and systems has made data difficult to access and use for decision-making.
This is an inefficient use of  scarce resources. We must do better, both to fulfill our own mandates and, critically, 
to deliver to the best of  our ability for the people we serve.  
Traditional organizations, especially those with large bureaucratic structures, must now play catch-up. We 
need to reform our policies and practices to enable the most strategic investments in digitally supported 
development work, and to strengthen our capacity to implement against this new vision.
The Principles for Digital Development can help inform and guide this process. This report is the culmination 
of  rich and detailed discussions about these Principles by more than 500 individuals representing over  
100 organizations working in international development. It captures their experiences, insights, questions, 
and recommendations to inform a landscape of  where we are in our understanding of  this guidance, and how 
we can chart a path forward.
This report is an important new tool for the development executive seeking to navigate this period of  
transition, and for others seeking to increase the success of  digital development. We welcome your comments

Executive Summary
For over a decade the international development community has been exploring how the use of  digital 
technologies, including tools like the mobile phone, can extend the reach of  development. At the same time, 
development organizations have grappled with how to use these technologies to make their own work more 
participatory, sustainable, and effective. 
The results have been mixed. Some projects have succeeded, enabling improved and sustained access to 
information and services that previously were out of  reach for marginalized populations. Other projects have 
failed, often due to preventable reasons, resulting in hundreds, if  not thousands of  projects being unable to scale. 
In the late 2000s, several donors and multilateral organizations began talking about failure in using digital 
tools to support development. Soon, sets of  principles, lessons, and best practices started emerging, beginning 
with the UNICEF Innovation Principles in 2009. One year later, a group of  mHealth implementers and donors 
independently developed a different set of  principles known as the Greentree Principles. The Principles for 
Digital Development (Principles) were created through the integration and refinement of  these two previous 
sets of  principles. 
Since June 2014, members of  the international development community have convened through a dozen 
meetings to discuss the Principles in detail. This report is the synthesis of  those and other events at which the 
community talked about what it means to put the Principles into practice. It identifies common barriers to the 
Principles’ successful implementation and suggests resources to help overcome these barriers. It also includes 
the following recommendations: 
Recommendations for All Development Actors
!   Have an institutional vision and strategy supporting the integration of  digital development best practice.
!   Ensure implementation of  the strategy is adequately staffed and resourced, and supported by enabling 
policies and processes.
!   Commit to integrating best practice into business processes.
Recommendations for Donor and Multilateral Organizations
!   Complement internal digital development strategies with an external strategy that lays out a vision for 
development implementers, and aligns with that of  other global development donors.
!   Build the digital development commons.
!   Adapt procurement processes to enable integration of  best practice.
!   Adapt other policies and processes to enable integration of  best practice into business processes.
Recommendations for Development Implementers
!   Align internal digital development strategies with those of  the wider global development community.
!   Contribute to the digital development commons.
!   Adapt business processes to enable operationalization of  best practice.

INTRODUCTION
Principles Origin 
For over a decade, the international development community has explored how the use of  modern digital tools like the 
mobile phone, can extend the reach of  development. At the same time, development organizations have grappled with 
how to use these technologies to make their own work more participatory, sustainable, and effective. 
The development community has seen some great successes, in which digitally supported programs enabled access to 
information and services that previously were beyond reach for marginalized and vulnerable populations. But it also 
has seen its share of  failure, often times for predictable and preventable reasons. This failure has resulted in hundreds, 
if  not thousands, of  projects that were unable to move beyond pilot stage. 
Starting in the late 2000s, several large donors and multilateral organizations began talking about failure in the use 
of  technology in development. Soon, sets of  principles, lessons, and best practices began emerging, beginning with 
the UNICEF Innovation Principles in 2009. A year later, a group of  40 mHealth implementers and donors met and 
independently developed a different set of  guidance known as the Greentree Principles. These two sets of  principles were 
organized and worded differently, but encompassed similar ideas. Other sets of  similar principles soon followed, some 
focused at the national level like the UK’s Government Design Services Digital Principles, and others related to internal, 
institutional procurement processes, such as the World Bank’s Open Development Principles.
Yet project failures continued. 
“We need to take discussion of best practice to the next level, where more people are more knowledgeable about how digital technologies 
can benefit the work we are doing, and what the potential risks are. The Principles for Digital Development are a framework for 
considering both the possibilities and the challenges that digital development can present.”

“We wanted to take the Principles and road test them with a wider community of practitioners and implementers. We wanted to grow 
ownership of these concepts, and rearticulate them with the voice, perspective, and experience of the development community.” 
~ Merrick Schaefer, USAID
Principles launched the Principles for Digital Development Working Group in June 2014. The Working Group includes 
donor representatives and practitioners from many development organizations—including both non-profits and 
consultancies undertaking digital development projects funded by large donor organizations. 
The goal of  this initial phase of  broader community discussion was to enable the Principles to be interpreted and 
articulated in more detail by some of  the organizations who stood to gain the most from a discussion of  what it would 
mean to change the way digital development is done. 
Participants in the yearlong community consultation period were largely the change agents (e.g., people with practical 
experience or expertise in digital development) within organizations, although occasionally senior leadership and other 
program staff  joined the conversation as well. 
The Working Group met nine times to discuss each of  the Principles individually through in-person deep dive events 
that, in most cases, also engaged remote participants online through video or teleconference. These sessions were hosted 
by Abt Associates, Catholic Relief  Services, Creative Associates International, Dalberg Global Development Advisors, 
IDEO.org, FHI 360, Internews, John Snow Inc. , Mercy Corps, the National Democratic Institute, Palladium (formerly 
Futures Group), and UN Global Pulse. 
Together, these discussions marked the beginning of  a shared understanding of  what the Principles mean in practice, 
including how to identify and overcome barriers to their successful operationalization. A two-page synthesis of  the 
community-led articulation of  what each Principle means in practice can be found in the Principles for Digital Development 
Community Insights booklet available at www.digitalprinciples.org/insights. 
The Principles also were discussed at a number of  development forums including the CRS ICT4D conference, M&E 
Tech, and the Global Health Forum at the mHealth Summit. All together, these events spanned cities including Accra, 
Baltimore, Chicago, Helsinki, London, Nairobi, New Delhi, New York, and San Francisco.
In addition to these discussions, the Working Group strategized about ways to move from Principle to practice by 
institutionalizing lessons learned from digital development successes and failures. With a few notable exceptions, 
however, the overwhelming majority of  participants in these discussions were not senior executives with broad  
policy-making and budgetary authority within their organizations. 
To raise awareness of  the Principles at executive levels of  these organizations, and to promote senior-level buy-in 
to the ideas that the Principles represent, USAID launched an endorsement campaign for the Principles for Digital 
Development in May 2015. Endorsing organizations are asked to provide a written statement with senior-level signature 
on the statement:
“As an endorser of the Principles for Digital Development, we will seek to embody the concepts the Principles represent in our ethos, our 
work culture, and in the policies and processes guiding our international development activities.”

donors and multilateral organizations involved in 
drafting the Principles have embarked on internal 
reform processes.
UNICEF, one of  the first organizations to develop its own guiding principles based on learning from digital development 
failures, took steps to publicize and socialize these principles across its massive, 190 country global footprint. 
USAID, another co-author and early proponent of  the Principles, has identified two separate reform processes that it is 
seeking to leverage to increase awareness of  and adherence to the ideas embodied in the Principles. 
Policy Reform at USAID
At USAID, the U.S. Global Development Lab is engaged in two internal reform processes that offer opportunities 
to weave Principles guidance into enforceable USAID policy. Should these efforts be successful, they will help code 
Principles guidance into the DNA of  the agency’s operations by making USAID programming more responsive to  
real-time data, and by guiding USAID procurements toward entities whose operations reflect the Principles.

WHAT IT IS Program cycle reform: USAID’s Bureau of Policy, Planning and Learning (PPL) is undertaking 
an agency-wide reform process in revising ADS 200-203 and strengthening the Program Cycle. 
These revisions intend to better support planning and implementation in the field, and allow for 
more adaptive and iterative operations through more flexible and sustainable programming. The U.S. 
Global Development Lab’s Development Informatics team is working closely with PPL to incorporate 
capacities that would enable greater program flexibility and adaptation based on real-time data.
WHAT IT This reform process seeks to institutionalize the guidance in Principle #5: Be Data Driven by establishing 
WOULD DO policies and processes to close the gap between monitoring and evaluation cycles that can take months 
or even years to complete, and the availability of real-time data that can be used to inform program-
ming at the time when data is needed for decision-making. 
WHAT IT IS Procurement reform: USAID is exploring novel approaches to procurement that allow for more 
iterative and adaptive planning and operations. The U.S. Global Development Lab is also working with 
USAID Operating Units and Missions to help them better understand the variety of contracting 
options already available that allow for more flexibility and emphasize co-creation.
WHAT IT This reform process seeks to provide the guidance necessary to ensure that USAID funds are directed

reflected in the Principles for Digital Development. 
 
Other government donors are taking concrete steps to put the Principles into practice. The UK’s Department 
for International Development (DFID), for example, announced2 in late 2015 that in all new procurements, 
partners and suppliers will be required to demonstrate how they plan to adhere to relevant Principles. 
Building Organizational Capacity
International donor organizations are taking other steps as well. Both the Swedish International Development 
Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and USAID have conducted internal trainings on the Principles to build digital 
development capacity among staff  operating across a wide variety of  sectors, countries, and technical areas of  
expertise. SIDA also has created a digital development practitioner network that enables its staff to share experiences 
and insights across a breadth of  sectors, including human rights and democracy building. USAID, through its 
U.S. Global Development Lab, has held four digital development trainings: two 
in Accra, Ghana, that reached staff across the West Africa region, one in Delhi, `

INTRODUCTION
International Development. The guide reflects CRS’ own ICT4D strategy, which was first assembled in 2008 to build 
capacity for technology and programming in the field. The guide shows how digitally supported approaches to 
development can add value, and provides practical guidance around implementation. 
Development Alternatives Incorporated (DAI) also took steps to build the knowledge and capacity of  its staff  to implement 
best practice. In 2015 DAI ran a six-month training course based on the Principles for Digital Development, which a total 
of  55 staff  completed through monthly half-day training sessions that included both in-person and remote participants. 
Participants were provided with reading assignments, workshop and activity sessions to game out specific scenarios, and 
office hours for staff  who had follow up questions. DAI subsequently condensed the course for delivery as part of  the 
USAID-funded Cambodia Development Innovations Project to provide continued training on incorporating the Principles 
into project work plans in Cambodia. “As a result of  the training, proposal and project teams are more aware of  what they 
know and what they don’t [know]. They are able to understand the importance of  thoughtful incorporation of  digital tools 
into program design and delivery,” said Krista Baptista, head of  the ICT Services Team at DAI.
Report Goal & Audience 
This report is the culmination of  the initial phase of  community discussion and activities around the Principles. The 
primary audiences for this report are development managers—individuals who can influence policy-making and 
budgetary authorities within organizations whose primary mission is to further international development, whether 
as a non-profit, corporation, foundation or social enterprise. For the development manager, the report provides a 
record of  a year of  community discussion of  the Principles for Digital Development, distilled into tips regarding their 
implementation, including how to overcome common obstacles. 
Through three main sections the report is designed to: 
Introduction !   Close the feedback loop by capturing highlights from the year of  discussions and sharing   
  them publicly, both for the groups that have already engaged and for audiences who have   
  yet to come to the table
Principles in Focus !   Provide a community-led definition of  what each Principle means in practice, including   
  case studies that illustrate by example
 !   Surface common barriers to implementation and, where possible, tie them to concrete  
  recommendations
Conclusion !   Identify common themes across these recommendations and note areas that need further   
  investigation, analysis, reflection, and action
Report Methodology 
This report draws from over a year of  discussion including Principles for Digital Development  
Working Group members and others who participated in events at which the Principles were discussed. It also draws 
from one-on-one discussions with over a dozen individuals who expressed interest in sharing more detailed insights 
to inform this report. A three-week public comment period between October 28 and November 13, 2015 enabled broad, 
public input from those who have participated in this discussion to date, as well as from new audiences.

Principles  
in Focus
|  13 
PRINCIPLE  1: Design with the User
“The Principles are pivotally different from the way development currently is being done. They are effectively building the rationale for 
a paradigm shift. They have the potential to transform development by democratizing it and making it more transparent.”   
~ Elie Calhoun, Code Innovation
The Principles for Digital Development are the result of  a concerted and consultative effort to learn from success and 
failure in digital development, but they are not perfect. The Principles do not, for example, solve all existing challenges 
to the fair, effective, sustainable, and secure use of  technology in development projects. Neither do they answer difficult 
questions that arise from tensions between individual Principles, such as how to balance the move toward open data 
with the protection of  individual privacy and security. They also are written in high-level language, which can lead to 
varying interpretations of  what each Principle means.
For these and other reasons, the Principles are not designed to serve as a checklist. Indeed it would be difficult, if  not 
impossible, to implement all Principles simultaneously. Instead, the Principles are designed to serve as a heuristic 
approach to considering how lessons learned from digital development successes and failures can be translated into 
everyday practice. In this light, this report is structured to help implementers and decision-makers grapple with how to 
assess trade-offs between the Principles and where to apply limited resources.
This section of  the report is devoted to exploring each Principle in detail, including a closer look at what each Principle 
means, what common barriers practitioners have faced in putting the Principles in practice, and recommendations for 
overcoming these obstacles. 
For each Principle, the section includes an exploration of:
 
Definition How is this Principle currently defined? 
Why It’s Needed What shortcoming in digital development does this Principle address?
Community What insights and advice did practitioners share based on their experience in putting 
Discussion  this Principle into practice? What were common barriers to implementation and what  
 recommendations did the community surface to overcome these barriers?
Resources What reference tools are available for further information?
There’s still a view that technology will solve anything. But there’s a growing understanding that technology also comes 
with real challenges and ethical quandaries.”

the User
◃   Develop context appropriate solutions informed by user needs.
◃   Include all user groups in planning, development, implementation and assessment.
◃   Develop projects in an incremental and iterative manner.
◃   Design solutions that learn from and enhance existing workflows and plan for

◃   Ensure solutions are sensitive to, and useful for, the most marginalized populations: 
women, children, those with disabilities, and those affected by conflict and disaster.

PRINCIPLE  1: Design with the User
“Trying to implement solutions into communities—an outside-in approach—is the wrong way to do this. We need an inside-out 
approach, or just support for homegrown, home run solutions.” 
~ TMS Ruge, founder, Hive Colab
Why It’s Needed
Too often in the field of  international development digital tools are created, or digitally supported projects and systems 
are designed, without sufficient input from the stakeholders whose engagement and ownership are critical to long-
term success. This is true of  many development interventions, whether or not they involve a digital component; but 
digitally–supported projects may surface the impacts of  this flaw in more readily visible ways. Projects designed 
without sufficient user engagement can fail due to simple usability issues as opposed to flawed project or system design. 
Principle #1: Design with the User, provides recommendations to avoid this common pitfall.
Community Discussion
Users should be central to the design process of  digital development interventions, solutions, technologies, and 
programs—throughout the yearlong discussion period there was strong consensus on this point. Yet discussion of  this 
principle was not without friction. 
A number of  participants disagreed with the framing of  this Principle, pointing to the inherent bias that the designer 
is not the user. This speaks, they argued, to an underlying assumption that international development funders and

Part of  the contention arose from the question of  who the “user” is. Is it the field staff  of  international NGOs? Or 
the pregnant woman in a rural area that field staff  are working to support? How you see things depend on where you

Development in Complex Adaptive Systems3
Development economist Owen Barder writes that today there is a growing recognition that development should be 
seen not as fueled by any single ingredient, but rather by a diverse ecosystem of  factors. Development, he says, is the 
emergent process of  complex adaptive systems including political, economic, legal, and financial institutions and 
systems, and how they work together to increase quality of  life.
 
Barder calls the embrace of  both innovation and selection, a process he calls “creative destruction,” to harness complexity 
in the service of  development, and the creation of  feedback loops that promote adaptation suitable to the environment. 
The importance of  feedback mechanisms, he notes, is well documented and understood elsewhere, but it is only recently 
that theoreticians and economists have applied the study of  these systems in the context of  global development.

“In recent years we’ve seen an evolution in the [mHealth] ecosystem. We started in a phase of discordant proliferation, which led to a 
lot of people to question whether [pilots] were all just hype or if there was truly a pathway to scale. After a period of greater scrutiny 
and willingness to share, we are now entering a phase of greater integration and scale.”
~ Alain Labrique, Johns Hopkins University
Why It’s Needed
Too often international development projects fail to move beyond the pilot stage, or to reach anticipated scale, due to 
design flaws that limit the ability to scale. In some cases, scale is not a necessary criterion for success. In others, careful 
consideration of  the necessary inputs can help projects reach their full potential. Principle #3: Design for Scale provides 
considerations for how to design a project for maximum impact.
 
Community Discussion
Scale is often held out as the holy grail of  digital development programming: the moment at which you know your 
project or program has succeeded. Yet is scale always necessary for success? And how do you know when your project 
has reached scale?
Many projects claim to have “scaled,” but what scale means in each context may look different. Some define it on a 
horizontal axis, as in the breadth of  counties, countries, or users reached. Others argued that we need a more nuanced 
definition of  scale along a vertical access, as in the depth to which organizations such as a partner government ministry 
change workflows and processes as a result of  the project or program.
Discussion of  scale led to consensus on a number of  insights and some practical advice that can help lead to a well-
informed definition and consideration of  scale.

Too often international development projects fail to factor in the physical, human, and financial resources that will

digital development solution or system’s longevity for the intended duration.
 
Community Discussion
Sustainability should be one of  the most important goals of  digital development interventions, but too often it is 
inadequately considered. This may be due in part to the nature of  funding cycles, which provide incentives for donor 
organizations to ensure projects and programs are implemented up until the funds are spent. After this time, projects 
often wither away, in many cases ripping away any benefit end users may have derived.
Some have argued that this is dangerous, and indeed may undermine the very market forces that could otherwise 
intervene to meet development needs. In a 2011 blog post entitled “The Subtle Condescension of  ICT4D,” Ushahidi  
co-founder Erik Hersman wrote:
 
“[T]he funds and work put into this space by the NGOs are creating a false floor in the economy. They’re undermining the community  
of tech entrepreneurs who could be building the same products and services and charging for it, just like we’d expect any company in  
the West to do if there was a valuable service worth paying for. If it’s a service that should be supplied by the government, then they’re 
short-circuiting those responsibilities and subsidizing actions that subvert the public offices away from their duty.”
 
This opinion may not be universally shared, but it clearly points to an important and open question in international 
development: Where does development stop and where does enterprise begin?
 
Considering this question opens a series of  related questions: Where are there areas of  overlap between development 
and enterprise, and what models should digital development practitioners consider in building for sustainability?  
What kinds of  technology solutions are most likely to demonstrate and transition to commercial viability? What ethical  
considerations should be borne in mind as projects move from development projects to business enterprises? Should 
some projects never move to private ownership?

PRINCIPLE  5: Be Data Driven
Why It’s Needed
Too often, international development projects fail to fully leverage data to support project planning and decision-
making. The consequences of  not sufficiently making data-driven decisions are not well understood, but can include 
diluted impact and unintended outcomes. Principle #5: Be Data Driven provides tips to identify the sources of, and 
incorporate data into, project design and decision-making.
Community Discussion
Data is in many ways the DNA of  development projects—a fundamental building block that informs how interventions 
are designed, implemented, and evaluated. Technology has opened up many new data sources, moving us from a 
paradigm where data was costly, rare, infrequent, and poor quality, to one where it can be cheap, abundant, and available 
in real-time or near real-time. Yet many gaps still exist in our collective ability to access and use data, and many open 
questions remain about data ownership, use and reuse, and minimum standards of  data privacy and security. 
Some of  these issues are addressed in the 2015 report A World That Counts, prepared by the Secretary-General’s 
Independent Expert Advisory Group on a Data Revolution for Sustainable Development. Increasingly, data is 
recognized as critical to enabling progress toward the reframed Sustainable Development Goals.
Over the year of  discussions about the Principles for Digital Development, there was clear consensus on one point: 
Improvements in our ability to harness the growing volume and velocity of  data that accompany increasing digitization of  
development projects offer some of  the greatest promise for the future. Yet much work remains to reap the full rewards.

Audit Requirements and Adaptive Programming Goals
One of  the challenges articulated by development practitioners funded by USAID is the inherent tension between the 
desire for data-driven, adaptive programming and requirements by the USAID Inspector General.
 
“When the USAID Inspector General comes in to review projects, they look at the original RFP or RFA. They look at the originally 
defined objectives and goals, and that is how they’re going to judge the performance of the project. When there’s a lot of evolution 
and change in the project activities, regardless of the source—it could be from country mission, an implementing partner, a country 
government, or some combination of the three—from the Inspector General’s perspective that can be a source of criticism of the project.” 
-  Anonymous
 
USAID has taken note of  this conflict and is seeking to reform its procurement process that governs the conditions 
and regulations according to which it allocates funds. This reform seeks to relieve the tension between the guidance to 
pursue data-driven adaptive programming and auditing that requires strict adherence to a program as it was originally 
envisioned before programming began.

Why It’s Needed
Too often in international development, scarce public resources are spent investing in code, tools, and innovations 
that are either locked away behind expensive licenses, and/or are invested in the creation of  unique, sector-specific 
solutions. Principle #6: Use Open Data, Open Standards, Open Source, and Open Innovation, provides a framework to consider an 
“open” approach to digital development.
Community Discussion
One set of  obstacles to the sustainability of  digital development programs emerges from the use of  competing and non-
interoperable systems, which fragment a clear picture of  data about development outcomes and needs. Another relates 
to the lack of  visibility into the data generated about and by these programs. A third set of  obstacles emerges from the 
design and implementation of  programs by practitioners who lack sufficient familiarity with or long-term investment 
in the communities where solutions are used. Principle #6: Use Open Data, Open Standards, Open Source, and Open Innovation is 
designed to address these obstacles by underscoring the importance of  “open” approaches to digital development.
 
This Principle may be the most contentious of  the series. Open data can catalyze business growth, citizen engagement 
and foster government accountability, but some data sets also have serious privacy and security implications. The 
decision about whether to pursue open source or proprietary software solutions also can be controversial—each  
entails trade-offs. As with the other Principles, this Principle offers guidance for consideration, rather than a checklist 
of  must-do items.

Why It Is Needed
As the use of  information and communications technologies in international development has matured, so too has the 
foundation of  methods, standards, software, platforms, and other tools. Despite this rich base of  technologies available 
for use, too often scarce development resources are spent building new tools when instead existing resources could be 
adapted and improved. Principle #7: Reuse and Improve suggests how to avoid reinventing the wheel.
 
Community Discussion
‘Reuse’ implies taking the time to assess what resources are currently available and whether these tools could be reused 
without modification; ‘improvement’ suggests doing these things and then adapting existing tools to specific program 
or project needs—ideally sharing improved code back to the community.
Over the course of  discussion, there was little debate around the importance of  reuse and improvement to the future 
of  digital development. Not only was this seen as an efficient use of  scarce resources, it was noted that a lack of  reuse 
diverts resources away from the further development of  existing tools.
There was largely consensus that building on existing platforms provides pathways to scale that would otherwise be 
closed, assures development projects are in sync with national strategies, and allows limited resources to be focused on 
bolstering specific interventions instead of  building core functionality from scratch.

“Unless we react quickly, there’s going to be a data scandal. Someone’s database with lots of sensitive information is going to get 
exposed. [Development organizations] have tons of this data, [...] consultants have it, [and it’s stored on] laptops. This is very intimate, 
private information. We are adamant that our personal information is protected, but everybody has rights to these protections, not just 
us. So the question becomes how do we equip organizations with the policies, practices, and standards that enable these protections, 
particularly when moving from analog to digital tools.”  
~ Maliha Khan, independent consultant
Why It’s Needed
Information is power, as the old adage goes, and this is certainly true in the context of  technology-enabled global 
development interventions. How information is collected, stored, analyzed, shared, and used has serious implications for 
both the populations about whom data are being transmitted, and the organizations transmitting the data. Yet as the 
digital development field evolved, privacy and security were often not considered sufficiently, if  at all.
As the field of  digital development matures—including through independent projects getting pulled together into 
larger systems, and digital programs progressing from housing hundreds to thousands of  records—the international 
development field needs to more conscientiously address these concerns. Principle 8: Address Privacy and Security provides 
a framework for considering how to protect user privacy and the security of  data, devices, and tools.
Community Discussion
In many respects, Principle 8: Address Privacy and Security is the most important for the ethical implementation of  digital 
development projects. By generating data about individuals’ identities, behaviors, activities, and locations, technology 
opens the door for unintended and unanticipated outcomes that can lead to significant risks, particularly for the most 
vulnerable populations. 
Beyond keeping personal information private, and data that is collected secure, addressing privacy and security is about 
respect for and protection of  the individual producers of  data, and preserving their fundamental human rights.
The integration of  digital tools into international development is requiring new principles, policies, and practices with 
regard to data privacy and protection. This is particularly true in an era of  big data. While it may require significant 
investment, when implemented, privacy and security solutions benefit human rights, development goals, development 
organizations, and partners by protecting their interests and increasing trust.

PRINCIPLE  9: Be Collaborative
Why It’s Needed
The saying: “If  you want to go fast, go alone. If  you want to go far, go together” is attributed to an African proverb, but 
could easily be a mantra for technology-enabled development projects. Principle #9: Be Collaborative suggests strategies 
for leveraging and contributing to a broader commons of  resource, action, and knowledge to extend the impact of  
development interventions.
Community Discussion
Collaboration is at the heart of  international development intention: to provide support that enable communities 
to meet basic needs, and to develop sustainably. Yet the design of  international development architecture, which is 
organized by sector, itself  can inhibit collaboration between projects and entities that operate in independent sectors.
In the United States, for example, congressionally allocated funding is assigned earmarks that constrain how money can 
be spent, such as by sector. This becomes a major determinant of  USG-funded development program design. Moreover, 
competition, such as between development practitioners for grants, is common practice.
How do we reconcile the principle of  being collaborative against these structural realities of  how the sector operates? 
More well-tested tools and strategies are needed to supplement the high-level guidance and anecdotes that are the most 
common sources of  good practice on collaboration in digital development.

Constructing a Holistic Approach to Development: One Implementer’s Take
“Where does responsibility lie for addressing development holistically? Ask communities and they’ll speak from a 
holistic perspective,” says Merywen Wigley, Project Director at FHI 360. But the way the international development 
system is designed can make building and delivering holistic solutions difficult, she says.
“From the top, Congress says we have designated funding for a designated purpose, and [these funding flows] begin 
shaping RFPs and RFAs in a siloed way. We need to change the conversation to respond to the complexity and the 
reality of  people’s lives. This requires a paradigm shift at the global level. It requires changing the global development 
architecture, and how development is delivered and evaluated as well.”
This task would be daunting for any one organization, but she believes individual actions taken collectively as a 
movement could catalyze change.
“Implementing partners need to look for opportunities to say, ‘Hey, the RFP didn’t call for this, but we know that the 
evidence is there to amplify impact, so we’re going to put this [integrated approach] into our proposal.’ 
“People need to talk more to each other. We tend to run in circles of  those with similar technical expertise, and this 
develops collective blind spots. Within organizations there needs to be an effort to see how what one group is working 
on can be amplified by what another group is working on.” 
To address the challenge of  constructing more holistic approaches to development, FHI 360 is taking steps both 
internally, and in concert with other organizations.
Internally, FHI 360 is building a cadre of  specialists from across the organization to serve as “integrators,” who may 
be called upon to provide technical assistance to support integrated approaches on proposals and projects as merited. 
Externally, FHI 360 is a founding member of  the Locus Initiative, a consortium of  NGOs dedicated to advancing more 
holistic approaches to development.

Recommendations  
for Moving from  
Principle to Practice
|  59 
RECOMMENDATIONS
The Principles were written using high-level conceptual language in order to be straightforward and easy to understand. But the reality is that putting the Principles into practice can be complicated. Why? And what  should be done to make it easier to operationalize the lessons learned from past successes and failures in  
digital development?
 
This final section of  the report looks beyond tips and insights related to implementing each individual Principle to begin 
answering these questions. It examines some of  the structural reasons why implementing the Principles can be difficult. 
It also offers recommendations to address these structural barriers. Some of  these recommendations are moonshots: 
ambitious targets that would be difficult to implement, but that may hold some of  the greatest potential for significantly 
increasing the institutionalization of  lessons learned. Others are more easily accessible, and could be implemented with 
relative ease. All recommendations are grouped thematically at a high level, and supported by tactical bullets.
 
Why Is Putting the Principles into Practice Difficult?
Digital development programs operate in complex environments, and use technology that is constantly changing and 
continuously creating new demands in the way it is applied. The Principles attempt to create guidance to navigate this 
non-linear and constantly evolving landscape.
 
Putting the Principles into practice requires an investment of  time, attention, information, and technical expertise. Yet 
even with these investments, challenges remain. These challenges include tensions between individual Principles, and 
systemic challenges that face the global development sector more broadly.
Tensions Between the Principles
As this report has acknowledged, implementing all of  the Principles simultaneously and with equal effect would be 
difficult if  not impossible. It is for this reason that the Principles are proposed as guidance for consideration rather  
than a checklist to be followed.
 
Why? In addition to the complexity in the variety of  ways that these high level guiding concepts play out in 
implementation, there are instances in which the guidance embedded in individual Principles conflicts. In most  
cases, considering how the Principles operate in conjunction with one another reveals synergies that can deepen  
an informed digital development. But this is not true in all cases. The Principles can and do require attention to  
trade-offs, such as considering how to open development data (Principle #6) while protecting a data producer’s  
privacy and security (Principle #8).
 
Tensions between the Principles were the subject of  one Principles Working Group discussion. That discussion 
is documented in a blog post “Synergies and Tensions in the Principles for Digital Development” available on the 
Principles website.
60  |  FROM PRINCIPLE TO PRACTICE: Implementing the Principles for Digital Development
Structural Challenges
In addition, many of  the challenges facing the implementation of  best practice in digital development are the same 
challenges that face the global development sector more broadly. These include:
!   Constraints that originate from the international development architecture as it is currently designed, as seen in the 
organization of  activities into sector-specific silos, and the relatively short nature of  funding cycles relative to the 
entrenched nature of  the challenges that development funding seeks to address.
!   The complexity and nonlinear nature of  the contexts in which international development projects and programs 
operate, where the increased frequency of  natural disasters, for example, may threaten decades of  work focused on 
improving health, sanitation, and economic livelihoods.
!   The continued challenge of  integrating local partners into development projects in a way that enables relevance, 
accountability, local ownership, and sustainability of  projects over the long term.
!   The prevalence of  other constraints, such as misaligned incentives, a lack of  political will, and inertia around  
entrenched practices.
 
In some cases these challenges may be more noticeable, or felt more acutely, in the context of  digital development 
programs, which enable data to be seen more readily. Development data that is locked into sector-specific digital 
data management tools, for example, hinder the ability of  decision-makers to get a clear, comprehensive picture of  
development needs more readily than data that are collected on paper and can take weeks if  not months to process.
 
Recommendations for Moving from Principle to Practice
What can be done to overcome these challenges? Over the course of  the yearlong community discussion of  the 
Principles, a number of  recommendations for systems-level change emerged. As mentioned above, some of  these 
recommendations are aspirational while others are more easily accessible.
 
Recommendations for All Development Actors
Digital development must be recognized as its own discipline that requires professionalization and institutionalization. 
This is true in the global development sector and elsewhere, such as in academia where a growing number of  colleges 
and universities offer courses that touch on aspects of  the application of  digital to development goals, yet few offer 
specialized degrees in this area of  study.
 
Like gender, climate, and other newer cross cutting disciplines, in the global development sector digital development 
capacity must be both supported from the bottom up, and regulated from the top down. This requires increased 
awareness, education, and training to enable bottom-up capacity, and new strategies, policies, tools, and processes to 
enable effective top-down governance. The following recommendations address how to build this capacity.
 
|  61 
RECOMMENDATIONS
Have an institutional vision and strategy supporting the integration of digital development best practice.
!   All development sector actors must have an institutional vision and strategy for digital development that is  
adequately resourced, and enabled by supporting policies and processes.
!   Senior leadership should endorse the Principles, and articulate how digital strategies are integral to achieving  
development outcomes in the context of  their organization’s work.
 
!   This endorsement should be supported by an implementation or institutionalization strategy to put the Principles 
into practice, with milestones identified to measure progress and guide reform as needed.
 
Ensure implementation of the strategy is adequately staffed and resourced, and supported by enabling  
policies and processes.
!   Organizations should assess policies and processes to support adherence to this strategy.
!   Where existing policies and procedures inhibit the integration of  best practice, organizations should set  
reforms in motion.
!   Organizations should assess organizational staff  and technical capacity to implement this strategy across  
sectors, and at various stages of  implementation.
Commit to integrating best practice into business processes.
!   Organizations should treat digital development as a crosscutting and foundational discipline, using it to improve 
development outcomes across sectors and to improve development program delivery by (1) integrating digital 
development strategies early, and (2) tying digital development data to adaptive programming.
!   Organizations should integrate best practice by building staff  capacity across sectors and geographies, and 
operational units, making this best practice sector and business-process specific.
!   Build capacity through trainings on the Principles, and supporting knowledge exchange among staff, such as  
through peer working groups or other vehicles for staff  to share questions, lessons, and experience.
!   Organizations should monitor and measure success in implementation of  the strategy, building in opportunities  
to reward success and learn from failure, with corresponding incentives.
In addition to these recommendations for all development actors, the community discussion period also surfaced  
recommendations for specific audiences.
 
Recommendations for Donor and Multilateral Organizations
 As the selectors of  which organizations, programs, and activities are funded, and how they are funded, donor and  
multilateral organizations have a special responsibility to ensure the integration of  best practice in digital development.
 
62  |  FROM PRINCIPLE TO PRACTICE: Implementing the Principles for Digital Development
Complement internal digital development strategies with an external strategy that lays out a vision for  
development implementers, and aligns with that of other global development donors.
 
While donor and multilateral organizations must ensure that they have a coherent vision and strategy for digital  
development that supports their internal operations, they also must have a vision and strategy for the external  
digital development activities funded through a variety of  partners, from NGOs and their sub-grantees to national  
and regional government partners.
!   This external strategy should align with that of  other donor and multilateral organization stakeholders to ensure 
maximum coherency among projects and activities.
!   Additionally, this external strategy should set out a vision for development implementers, such as by requiring 
that technology solutions are addressed at the outset in implementer proposals, and requiring that technology 
subcontractors participate in work planning once contracts have been awarded.
Build the digital development commons.
Invest in inter-donor coordination around digital development, such as technical working groups, to ensure coherent 
policies and actions.
!   Invest in infrastructure that enables greater collaboration such as technologies and systems that work across  
development sectors, leverage standards, and have flexible program designs.
!    Invest in digital development knowledge-sharing systems, tools, and processes that can be accessed by a variety  
of  development partners.
!   Create funding models that build and sustain the digital development commons so that access to information and 
tools is sustainable over the long-term.
!   Assess digital development solutions to understand those that are commonly used, where they required continued 
investments, and where gaps remain.
 
Adapt procurement processes to enable integration of best practice.
Donor and multilateral organizations must acknowledge that the global development sector, as it is currently designed, 
creates counter-incentives to implementation of  many of  the Principles.
!   To overcome these structural constraints, integrate explicit guidance to adhere to relevant Principles in requests  
for proposals and other development funding application processes. In the reviewing proposals, award technical 
points to program designs that factor in the Principles.
 
!   Use funding mechanisms that enable more collaborative and participatory processes (and reduce parallel  
investments) such as co-design among local and global development partners, and mechanisms that enable  
co-funding among donors of  various component parts of  a digital development solution or implementation.
 
|  63 
RECOMMENDATIONS
!   Model case studies of  what works to move these examples from the exception to the norm. This modeling should 
include use of  internal policies and processes, as well as outcomes of  external, funded activities.
 
Create review boards for spending on digital development to provide input, feedback, and guidance on digital  
development strategy and spending.
!   Require an assessment of  the ecosystem prior to funding to enable reflection of  what is already in place. Incorporate 
these insights into RFPs and other funding opportunities.
!   Ensure that funded efforts build on national systems, reuse existing tools, and align with emergent local standards 
whenever possible.
 
Adapt accountability language to encourage partnership, particularly with national organizations, to ensure that  
existing requirements do not inhibit transition to in-country partners.
!   Forecast the transition of  digital development systems and build requirements into RFPs. Ensure funding and 
planning for the development of  ICT systems supports the transfer of  these systems to subsequent donor-funded 
development implementers and/or to a national stakeholder.
 
!   Find ways to reward grantees whose work embodies digital development best practice, such as the use of  points in 
funding proposals for the appropriate reuse of  existing systems and tools.
 
Adapt other policies and processes to enable integration of best practice into business processes.
Adapt program planning and evaluation mechanisms to enable responsiveness to digital data insights.
!   Adapt auditing structures and mechanisms to enable adaptation based on lessons learned while programs are  
underway, as well as permissions for grantees to do the same.
!   Analyze funding timelines to assess what development outcomes are feasible in short funding cycles, and where 
digital tools and systems are involved, what transition and business planning is required to sustain them beyond 
individual grant cycles.
!   Integrate the Principles into existing capacity building efforts across sectors, geographies, and operational units.
 
Recommendations for Development Implementers
Development practitioners who lead the implementation of  digital development solutions and programs also have a 
unique responsibility and role to play in the operationalization of  digital development best practice. Development im-
plementers—such as the large development NGOs, social enterprise grantees, and businesses that are grantees of   
development donors, and their subcontractors—should use the following recommendations to professionalize and 
institutionalize their engagement in digital development.
 
64  |  FROM PRINCIPLE TO PRACTICE: Implementing the Principles for Digital Development
Align internal digital development strategies with those of the wider global development community.
 
While development implementers must ensure that they have a coherent vision and strategy for digital development 
that supports their internal operations, they also must ensure coherence or alignment with the broader digital 
development community, including national and regional government partners, donor and multilateral organizations, 
NGOs,their sub-grantees, and the end users of  digital development information and services.
!   This internal strategy also should govern program and activity design, as well as how subcontractors are  
engaged and how they implement their activities to ensure maximum coherency across development implementer 
initiatives, and alongside contractor projects and activities.
!   Additionally, this internal strategy should require the direct engagement of, and consultation with, end users  
of  digital development information and services in all phases of  implementation, including planning, design,  
implementation, and evaluation.
Contribute to the digital development commons.
Participate in implementer coordination around digital development, such as through technical working groups,  
to ensure coherent policies and actions.
!   Use and contribute to infrastructure that enables greater collaboration such as systems that work across  
development sectors, leverage standards, and have flexible program designs.
!   Use and contribute to digital development knowledge-sharing systems, tools, and processes that can be accessed  
by a variety of  development partners.
!   Assess digital development solutions relevant to your organization’s work to understand those that are commonly 
used, where they required continued investments, and where gaps remain.
 
Adapt business processes to enable operationalization of best practice.
Operationalization of  the Principles requires that implementers commit to going beyond current global development 
requirements.
!   Leverage the Principles to demonstrate in funding proposals how operationalization of  the Principles can result in 
improved development outcomes, where possible pointing to evidence from related programs and activities.
 
!   Propose programs that enable more collaborative and participatory implementation processes, including co-design 
with national stakeholders, or collaboration with implementers working on a complementary aspect of  a digital 
development challenge or solution.
!   Integrate a digital strategist at program start-up and/or during work planning to asses tools, techniques, and  
partnerships that support digital development objectives, and consider trade-offs such as subcontracting for  
technical expertise and vendor lock-in.
 
|  65 
RECOMMENDATIONS
!   Contribute case studies of  what works to move these examples from the exception to the norm. This modeling  
should include use of  internal policies and processes, as well as development outcomes.
Adapt operating processes to encourage partnership with national stakeholders. Where donor requirements inhibit 
this collaboration, advocate for appropriate donor reform.
Forecast the transition of  digital development systems and build requirements into funding proposals to ensure  
that funding and planning for the development of  ICT systems supports the transfer of  systems to subsequent  
donor-funded development implementers and/or to a national stakeholder.
 
!   Adapt program monitoring & evaluation mechanisms to enable incorporation of  digital data-driven decision  
making into traditional monitoring and evaluation approaches.
!   Integrate the Principles into existing capacity building efforts across sectors, geographies, and operational units.

Vision for the Future
Maybe a starting point for the Principles would be to say: what do we want the future of ICT4D to be? What do we want that future to 
look like in 10 or 20 years? We need to paint that picture, and then bring it back to today and ask: What do we need to do to get there?”  
~ Ken Banks, founder, kiwanja.net
The Principles, for better or for worse, are designed around the system we currently have rather than the one we could 
or should have to best optimize for the future. A subsequent phase of  activities could undertake a visioning exercise to 
imagine a future unbound by the constraints of  the current international development system. How might gaps and 
opportunities developed through this approach be different from the Principles we have today?
To imagine this future, additional audiences should be brought to the table. Specifically, the conversation should be 
expanded to include more executive leadership of  development-focused organizations, and, critically, more voices at 
all levels from the countries and communities in which development programs operate. Among the latter group, this 
should include representatives of  government ministries and extension workers; national and local NGOs; the national 
staff  of  international NGOs; related national private sector players, and the consumers of  digital programming 
information and services themselves.
To translate interest and intent into action, more resources are needed to empower practitioners to integrate the 
Principles into their work in a meaningful way. A subsequent phase of  Principles activities should engage the digital 
development community (including donors and multilateral organizations, implementers, and the end users of  digital 
development services) in the prioritization and development of  these resources. Suggestions of  needed resources that 
surfaced during the first iteration of  community discussion included: 
 
!   User-contributed information repositories on a variety of  topics, from local ecosystems to available tools.
!   Decision-support tools, such as checklists, that can help navigate tradeoffs between Principles.
!   Guiding policies and frameworks, such as those addressing privacy and security and mitigating risks in digital development.
!   Additional case studies that show by example how the Principles have been put into practice, along with  
associated learning.
!   The documentation of  processes and planning for implementing digitally supported projects, and to refine these 
over time.
!   Further resources and recommendations to guide Principles implementation at various stages of  scale of  digital 
development solutions and programs.
The future of  digital development is open for crafting. The year of  community discussions surfaced many insights and 
recommendations, but marks just the beginning of  a broader and continuing conversation. This ongoing consultative 
process is an essential opportunity to ensure that existing and new lessons in digital development are continuously 
integrated into practice, and to make the most of  the opportunity to advance lives and livelihoods everywhere 
development programs operate.
