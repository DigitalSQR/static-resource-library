As	a	result	of	the	system	developed	by	FrontlineSMS,	visitors	of	the	museum	were	able
to	engage	with	the	artists	and	send	them	private	messages	about	the	art.	The
automated	SMS	workflows	allowed	us	to	add	a	bridge	between	our	incarcerated	artists
and	attendees,	and	capture	additional	information	from	our	attendees,	all	without
adding	to	our	daily	workload,	which	was	also	critical.
WHAT	 IS 	FRONTL INESMS?
Clever	automation	and	logic	(a	combination	of	technology	and	our	team’s	expertise)	that	sits	on	top	of	an	SMS	message	delivery	
service.	This	means	that	you	can	send	smart	messages	at	scale	–	that	can	make	sense	of	keywords	in	people’s	replies,	with	
automated	responses	tailored	to	your	community,		or	set	to	trigger	on	specific	prompts.	
This	ability	to	interact	over	SMS	is	invaluable	for	community	management,	information	tracking	or	collecting	research	data.
Why	SMS?
SMS	is	the	most	inclusive	means	of	communication	in	the	world.	99%	of	text	messages	are	read,	almost	every	human	on	earth	
has	access	to	a	phone,	and	every	model	of	mobile	phone	can	send	and	receive	text	messages.	The	barriers	to	entry	are	
incredibly	low:
• there	is	little	to	no	literacy	requirement	to	short	messaging
• it’s	inexpensive	for	both	senders	and	recipients
• text	messages	encourage	people	to	take	action
• hearing	back	immediately	is	satisfyingly	responsive
It’s	easy	and	rewarding	for	people	to	connect	with	information	sent	via	FrontlineSMS.	That’s	why	we	have	a	98%	
recommendation	rate.
What	do	people	use	FrontlineSMS	for?
• Universities	collecting	data	for	research	projects
• Medical	teams	running	clinical	trials	administration	and	results
• Charities	closing	the	feedback	loop	on	their	services	and	impact
