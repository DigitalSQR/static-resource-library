An Introduction to Mobile 
Health (mHealth)
In many places throughout the world, particularly in 
developing countries, access to healthcare is limited 
by lack of facilities, trained personnel, supplies, etc. 
mHealth, or mobile health, is the use of mobile technologies to support medical and 
public health practice and improve health outcomes through devices such as mobile 
phones, tablets, personal digital assistants (PDAs), patient monitoring devices, 
and more. 
 
mHealth can help mitigate some of the public health challenges many countries face, 
by providing cost-effective solutions for diagnosis and treatment support, supply 
chain management, adherence to medicine regimes, data collection, disaster man-
agement, and other health-related issues.  While the field of mHealth is still in early 
stages, there are indications that it is starting to transform health systems and extend 
the reach of health information and services to previously unreached populations.

an INTRODUCTION
Mobile phones can change the way health-care is delivered in the most rural 
and underserved parts of the world. There is now a way to have real-time, 
two-way communication with communities that are beyond the periphery of 
formal health systems.
Leveraging this emerging and unique solution space, we brought together 
public health, mobile health and design constituencies to start a conversation 
on how mHealth can contribute to speed the path to the prevention of 
mother to child transmission (PMTCT). This effort is aimed at improving the 
effectiveness of PMTCT programs as well as improving the quality of care for 
both users and service providers.

Presenting the 
framework
A baseline framework was introduced to provide a 
common model for aligning different opportunities 
and challenges across the care continuum. This 
framework was developed by UNICEF and frog 
based on their work in MNCH, incorporating 
UNICEF & WHO approved guidelines. 
Workshop participants were asked to test and refine 
the framework during the course of the day.

Defining Event Supported by the toolkit and the PMTCT Framework, the 
participants were asked to be a companion during the journey 
of a mother or a CHW for the first 1,000 days. Choosing a 
defining event as the starting point of the journey, helped them 
to further frame the user needs and better envision realistic 
interactions. Looking at well-known territory from this 
perspective helped them capture pain points, system voids and 
unmet or invisible needs.

The journey map was used as a landscape via which to 
discuss and define where mobile opportunities could 
play a role to support the unmet needs of mothers and 
CHW’s. The most promising opportunities and their 
corresponding value to the user were then mapped to

an INTRODUCTION
The use of mobile phone technologies to improve health outcomes (mHealth) is increasing, 
particularly in the areas of HIV and reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health 
(RMNCH). While still nascent, the body of evidence supporting the use of mHealth to improve 
both program processes and results is growing with promising signs toward addressing some 
of the key challenges in improving maternal and child health. Studies have demonstrated how 
mHealth contributes to reducing maternal mortality, implementing child health protocols, and 
promoting treatment adherence for HIV patients.
PMTCT & The Global Plan towards Elimination of New HIV Infections Among Children by 2015 and Keeping Mothers Alive and the 2012 International AIDS Conference theme, “Turning the Tide Together,” signal an urgency and renewed optimism to join forces and build momentum for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of HIV. It is also important to highlight 
the global shift toward the integration of health services. Understanding how interventions 
contribute to strengthening community and health systems underscores the importance of 
mHealth examining mHealth as it applies across the entire continuum of health services.This landscape brief provides a summary of current projects and the available evidence relating to the use and potential of mHealth for improving results in vertical transmission programs.

How mHealth Can 
Improve EMTCT and 
RMNCH: Experience 
and Evidence
There are a limited number of published studies that evaluate the impact of mHealth 
specifically on pregnant women who are HIV+ or who are registered for EMTCT 
prophylaxis. However, there are a number of significant studies and projects generating 
evidence relevant to using mHealth in EMTCT programs and other parts of the RMNCH 
continuum of care.

Coordination, Supervision Evidence
and Quality of Care A randomized control trial (RCT) in Kenya for pediatric malaria treatment showed use of text messaging improved treatment protocol 
management by nearly 25%.(1)

The role and responsibilities of community and other frontline health workers have been 
increasingly expanding and include such tasks as record keeping, following up with patients who

making referrals, and providing emotional support. Any tools that can help them perform their In Indonesia, mobile phones strengthened

Studies have demonstrated that mobile phones can be used to:

Demand, Awareness, 
Education, Tracking & 
Retention
Appointment Reminders
Nonattendance for appointments is a challenge to health care managers and providers. SMS 
appointment reminders support mothers and staff at health facilities. A majority of women 
access antenatal services at least once during pregnancy. However, many women are then 
subsequently lost to follow-up at several critical points of care, resulting in missed opportunities 
to reduce the risk of vertical transmission of HIV and promote maternal and child health. 
These critical points include testing, initiation of prophylactic or therapeutic ARVs, early infant 
diagnosis, uptake of family planning, and ongoing support and maternal care.
SMS reminders can decrease the number of appointments missed and increase communication 
exchange between patient and clinic. There is a emerging body of evidence demonstrating that 
mobile phones are being effectively used to transmit appointment reminders for women and 
their infants to visit clinics for basic antenatal services, HIV testing, early infant diagnosis (EID), 
immunizations, obtaining test results, and post-natal checkups. Reminders are sent either to 
community health workers or directly to the women themselves.

Treatment Adherence Evidence

remain alive and healthy to adequately care for their children. Pediatric treatment adherence is 
also critical to the survival and health of HIV+ infants.
The use of mHealth tools for HIV treatment adherence has the strongest evidence based upon At least two randomized control trials demonstrated 
the number of published studies with methodological rigor. While most of the studies have that patients receiving SMS text message support

as survey and electronic patient diaries.(13)

Other Potential Areas 
for the Use of mHealth
Using a systems analysis lens and remembering how EMTCT and RMNCH relate and feed 
into the entire health system is critical to determining how mHealth can be applied along 
the EMTCT and RMNCH continua of care. Important areas that directly impact EMTCT 
programs include:
• Supply chain management
• HIV prevention
• Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)
• Micro-finance
• Improving psycho-social well-being of mothers and community health workers
• Improving economic livelihoods in areas such as agriculture
• Reducing stigma and discrimination

Miscellaneous 
Lessons Learned from 
Stakeholder Interviews
• Mobile phones are more effective if used to reach mothers compared to reaching them 
vis-à-vis community health workers. 
• Sufficient back-end logistical support is critical for using mobile phones effectively in 
global health programs. 
• Illiteracy is an issue in most developing areas impacting the ability of mothers to directly 
receive information via SMS. 
• Experience shows that in many circumstances women would be willing to pay for an SMS 
service providing useful health information. However, this would need to be confirmed 
by market analysis. 
• Differences in using mHealth in urban and rural settings should be taken into account in 
program design. 
• Differences between whether a mother owns her own phone or has access to a phone that 
is shared with others should be taken into account in message content and program design. 
•  International guidelines regarding various components of EMTCT and RMNCH 
frequently change, making it imperative for frequent updates in an mHealth system to 
bring these changes to the field. 
• Mobile phones have potential to facilitate task shifting and increase efficiencies by shifting 
the work normally done in the clinics to the phone itself. For example, a series of questions 
about a patient’s condition can be posed through the phone to determine whether a patient 
needs to return to the clinic in 6 months rather than 3 months from the last visit. 
• Mobile phone vouchers are successfully being used as an incentive to HIV positive patients 
to adhere to treatment regimens.
