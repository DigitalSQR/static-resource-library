Many	development	experts	promote	information	and	communication	technology	(ICT)	as	a	way	to	relieve	global	poverty.
They	should	pay	more	attention	to	the	human	beings	who	use	it.

A	ten-year-old	boy	named	Dhyaneshwar	looked	up	for	approval	after	carefully	typing	the	word	“Alaska”	into
a	PC.
“Bahut	acchaa!”	I	cheered—“very	good.”
It	was	April,	2004,	and	I	was	visiting	a	“telecenter”	in	the	tiny	village	of	Retawadi,	three	hours	from
Mumbai.	The	small,	dirt-floored	room,	lit	only	by	an	open	aluminum	doorway,	was	bare	except	for	a	desk,	a
chair,	a	PC,	an	inverter,	and	a	large	tractor	battery,	which	powered	the	PC	when	grid	electricity	was
unavailable.	Outside,	a	humped	cow	chewed	on	dry	stalks,	and	a	goat	bleated	feebly.
As	I	encouraged	the	boy,	I	wondered	about	the	tradeoff	his	parents	had	made	in	order	to	pay	for	a	typing
tutor.	Their	son	was	learning	to	write	words	he’d	never	use,	in	a	language	he	didn’t	speak.	According	to	the
telecenter’s	owner,	Dhyaneshwar’s	parents	paid	a	hundred	rupees—about	$2.20—a	month	for	a	couple
hours	of	lessons	each	week.	That	may	not	sound	like	much,	but	in	Retawadi,	it’s	twice	as	much	as	full-time
tuition	in	a	private	school.
Such	was	my	introduction	to	the	young	field	of	ICT4D,	or	Information	and	Communication	Technologies
for	Development.	The	goal	of	ICT4D	is	to	apply	the	power	of	recent	technologies—particularly	the	personal
computer,	the	mobile	phone,	and	the	Internet—to	alleviate	the	problems	of	global	poverty.	ICT4D	sprouted
from	two	intersecting	trends:	the	emergence	of	an	international-development	community	eager	for	novel
solutions	to	nearly	intractable	socioeconomic	challenges;	and	the	expansion	of	a	brashly	successful
technology	industry	into	emerging	markets	and	philanthropy.

TIM	MAUDLIN
The	latter	prompted	my	own	move	to	India.	I	was	working	as	a	computer	scientist	for	Microsoft	Research	in
the	United	States	during	a	time	when	India’s	rise	as	an	information-technology	superpower	drew	to	that
country	increasing	investments	from	multinational	firms.	In	2004	I	was	asked	to	help	start	a	lab	in
Bangalore,	and	I	jumped	at	the	opportunity.	While	the	lab’s	broader	mission	was	to	engage	India’s	science
and	engineering	talent	in	computer-science	research,	I	would	have	the	chance	to	start	an	ICT4D	research
group,	where	I	hoped	to	devote	my	expertise	to	something	of	wider	societal	value.
At	the	time,	telecenters	were	the	poster	children	of	ICT4D.	Telecenters	are	like	Internet	cafés,	except	they
are	placed	in	impoverished	communities	with	the	intention	of	accelerating	socioeconomic	growth.	The
telecenters	are	often	sponsored	wholly	or	in	part	by	outside	agencies—governments,	NGOs,	academia,
industry—harboring	a	variety	of	secondary	aims,	from	profits	and	publicity	to	increased	interaction	with	a
voting	constituency.
In	Retawadi	the	telecenter	was	created	jointly	by	a	for-profit	start-up	company	and	a	local	nonprofit.	The
partners	believed	that	the	telecenter	would	provide	social	services	to	the	community	and	income	for	a	local
entrepreneur,	and,	in	fact,	it	did	a	bit	of	both.	When	I	visited,	the	telecenter	had	two	students.	Occasionally,
a	college-aged	youth	would	come	in	to	use	the	Internet	for	the	equivalent	of	$0.25	per	hour.	And	the	owner
boasted	that	he	earned	additional	income	by	using	the	PC	himself	to	provide	a	local	hospital	with	data-entry
services.
Some	telecenters	have	been	successful.	One	operator	in	South	India	reported	saving	a	farmer’s	okra	crop	by
enabling	a	timely	video	teleconference	between	him	and	a	university	agriculture	expert.	Another	boasted	a
threefold	increase	in	income	after	opening	a	computer-training	center.	The	press	headlines	have	been
unabashedly	flattering:	“India’s	Soybean	Farmers	Join	the	Global	Village”	(The	New	York	Times);	Village
Kiosks	Bridge	India’s	Digital	Divide”	(The	Washington	Post);	“Kenyan	Farmer	Lauds	Internet	as	Saviour	of
Potato	Crop”	(BBC).
These	stories	have	sparked	high	hopes	for	telecenters:	distance	education	will	make	every	child	a	scholar;
telemedicine	can	cure	dysfunctional	rural	health-care	systems;	citizens	will	offer	each	other	services	locally
and	directly,	bypassing	corrupt	government	officials.	Ashok	Jhunjhunwala,	a	member	of	the	Indian	Prime
Minister’s	Science	Advisory	Council,	suggested	that	telecenters	could	double	incomes	in	rural	villages.	M.S.
Swaminathan,	widely	credited	with	India’s	“Green	Revolution”	in	agriculture,	called	for	a	telecenter	in	each
of	the	country’s	640,000	villages.	Other	countries	have	followed	suit,	proclaiming	their	own	national
telecenter	programs.
Technology—no	matter	how	well	designed—is	only	a	magnifier
of	human	intent	and	capacity.	It	is	not	a	substitute.
The	excitement	around	telecenters	has	spread	to	the	rest	of	ICT4D.	Prominent	people	in	both	the
technology	and	development	sectors	eagerly	fan	the	flames,	and	proponents	of	ICT4D	increasingly	wrap	it
in	the	language	of	needs	and	rights.	Nicholas	Negroponte—founder	of	One	Laptop	Per	Child	(OLPC),	a
project	devoted	to	getting	inexpensive	laptops	into	the	hands	of	every	poor	child—claims,	“Kids	in	the
developing	world	need	the	newest	technology,	especially	really	rugged	hardware	and	innovative	software.”
Kofi	Annan	has	publicly	backed	the	project.	Edward	Friedman,	director	of	the	Center	for	Technology
Management	for	Global	Development,	epitomized	engineers	involved	in	ICT4D	when	he	wrote,	“There	is	a
pressing	need	to	employ	information	technology	for	rural	healthcare	in	sub-Saharan	Africa.”	One	recent
worldwide	survey	commissioned	by	the	BBC	found	that	79	percent	of	the	nearly	28,000	adults	polled—
mainly	from	richer	countries	and	those	with	Internet	access—strongly	agreed	or	somewhat	agreed	with	the
statement,	“Access	to	the	Internet	should	be	a	fundamental	right	of	all	people.”
Yet	the	successes	of	ICT4D	are	few,	fleeting,	and	very	far	between.	In	Retawadi	the	telecenter	owner	made
approximately	twenty	dollars	per	month,	but	monthly	costs	of	hardware,	electricity,	connectivity,	and
maintenance	were	a	hundred	dollars.	The	telecenter	closed	shortly	after	my	visit.
Over	a	span	of	five	years	I	traveled	to	nearly	50	telecenters	across	South	Asia	and	Africa.	The	vast	majority
looked	a	lot	like	the	one	in	Retawadi.	Locals	rarely	saw	much	value	in	the	Internet,	and	telecenter	operators
couldn’t	market	even	the	paltry	services	available.	Most	suffered	the	same	fate	as	the	Retawadi	telecenter,
shutting	down	soon	after	they	opened.	Research	on	telecenters,	though	limited	in	rigor	and	scale,	confirms
my	observations	about	consistent	underperformance.
As	I	soon	discovered,	these	mostly	failed	ventures	reflect	a	larger	pattern	in	technology	and	development,	in
which	new	technologies	generate	optimism	and	exuberance	eventually	dashed	by	disappointing	realities.
Academic	observers	have	deconstructed	telecenters	and	other	ICT4D	projects,	enumerating	the	many
reasons	why	the	initiatives	fail:	ICT4D	enthusiasts	don’t	design	context-appropriate	technology,	adhere	to
socio-cultural	norms,	account	for	poor	electrical	supply,	build	relationships	with	local	governments,	invite
the	participation	of	the	community,	provide	services	that	meet	local	needs,	consider	bad	transportation
the	participation	of	the	community,	provide	services	that	meet	local	needs,	consider	bad	transportation
infrastructure,	think	through	a	viable	financial	model,	provide	incentives	for	all	stakeholders,	and	so	on.
These	criticisms	are	each	valid	as	far	as	they	go,	and	ICT4D	interventionists	sometimes	focus	narrowly	on
addressing	them.	But	this	laundry	list	of	foibles	ultimately	provides	no	insight	into	the	deeper	reasons	why
ICT4D	projects	rarely	fulfill	their	promise,	even	as	their	cousins	in	the	developed	world	thrive	in	the	form	of
netbooks,	BlackBerrys,	and	Facebook.
Nothing	would	have	pleased	my	group	more	than	finding	a	way	for	technology	to	advance	the	cause	of
poverty	alleviation.	But	as	we	conducted	research	projects	in	multiple	domains	(education,	microfinance,
agriculture,	health	care)	and	with	various	technologies	(PCs,	mobile	phones,	custom-designed	electronics),
a	pattern,	having	little	to	do	with	the	technologies	themselves,	emerged.	In	every	one	of	our	projects,	a
technology’s	effects	were	wholly	dependent	on	the	intention	and	capacity	of	the	people	handling	it.	The
success	of	PC	projects	in	schools	hinged	on	supportive	administrators	and	dedicated	teachers.	Microcredit
processes	with	mobile	phones	worked	because	of	effective	microfinance	organizations.	Teaching	farming
practices	through	video	required	capable	agriculture-extension	officers	and	devoted	nonprofit	staff.	In	our
most	successful	ICT4D	projects,	the	partner	organizations	did	the	hard	work	of	real	development,	and	our
role	was	simply	to	assist,	and	strengthen,	their	efforts	with	technology.
If	I	were	to	summarize	everything	I	learned	through	research	in	ICT4D,	it	would	be	this:	technology—no
matter	how	well	designed—is	only	a	magnifier	of	human	intent	and	capacity.	It	is	not	a	substitute.	If	you
have	a	foundation	of	competent,	well-intentioned	people,	then	the	appropriate	technology	can	amplify	their
capacity	and	lead	to	amazing	achievements.	But,	in	circumstances	with	negative	human	intent,	as	in	the
case	of	corrupt	government	bureaucrats,	or	minimal	capacity,	as	in	the	case	of	people	who	have	been	denied
a	basic	education,	no	amount	of	technology	will	turn	things	around.
The	myth	of	scale	is	the	religion	of	telecenter	proponents,	who
believe	that	bringing	the	Internet	into	villages	is	enough	to
transform	them.
Technology	is	a	magnifier	in	that	its	impact	is	multiplicative,	not	additive,	with	regard	to	social	change.	In
the	developed	world,	there	is	a	tendency	to	see	the	Internet	and	other	technologies	as	necessarily	additive,
inherent	contributors	of	positive	value.	But	their	beneficial	contributions	are	contingent	on	an	absorptive
capacity	among	users	that	is	often	missing	in	the	developing	world.	Technology	has	positive	effects	only	to
the	extent	that	people	are	willing	and	able	to	use	it	positively.	The	challenge	of	international	development	is
that,	whatever	the	potential	of	poor	communities,	well-intentioned	capability	is	in	scarce	supply	and
technology	cannot	make	up	for	its	deficiency.
This	point	may	sound	reasonable	enough	when	stated	in	the	abstract,	but	it	has	an	important	consequence
for	anyone	expecting	to	save	the	world	with	technology:	you	can’t	.	.	.	at	least,	not	unless	the	technology	is
applied	where	human	intent	and	capacity	are	already	present,	or	unless	you	are	willing	also	to	invest	heavily
in	developing	human	capability	and	institutions.
The	converse	belief—accepted	as	faith	by	technocrats	and	techno-utopians—is	that	the	large-scale
dissemination	of	appropriately	designed	technology,	per	se,	can	provide	solutions	to	poverty	and	other
social	problems.	Believers	jump	to	address	the	scale	of	global	problems	before	confirming	the	value	of	the
solution.	They	equate	technology	penetration	with	progress.	For	example	OLPC	seeks	to	enable	“self-
empowered	learning.”	Teachers	can	be	altogether	absent;	OLPC	has	consistently	sold	its	technology	with
little	discussion	of	the	realities	of	pedagogy—training	teachers,	redesigning	curricula,	strengthening	weak
little	discussion	of	the	realities	of	pedagogy—training	teachers,	redesigning	curricula,	strengthening	weak
school	systems.	As	for	technical	maintenance,	the	students	are	supposed	to	provide	it	themselves.	OLPC’s
very	name	implies	that	its	goal	is,	primarily,	widely	disseminated	technology.	Yet,	few	of	us	would	choose
PC-based	education	for	our	own	children.
This	myth	of	scale	is	the	religion	of	telecenter	proponents,	who	believe	that	bringing	the	Internet	into
villages	is	enough	to	transform	them.	Most	recently,	there	is	the	cult	of	the	mobile	phone:	one	New	York
Times	Magazine	headline	ran,	“Can	the	Cellphone	Help	End	Global	Poverty?”	The	article	went	on	to	assert,
“the	possibilities	afforded	by	a	proliferation	of	cellphones	are	potentially	revolutionary.”
“Revolutionary.”	The	myth	of	scale	is	seductive	because	it	is	easier	to	spread	technology	than	to	effect
extensive	change	in	social	attitudes	and	human	capacity.	In	other	words,	it	is	much	less	painful	to	purchase
a	hundred	thousand	PCs	than	to	provide	a	real	education	for	a	hundred	thousand	children;	it	is	easier	to	run
a	text-messaging	health	hotline	than	to	convince	people	to	boil	water	before	ingesting	it;	it	is	easier	to	write
an	app	that	helps	people	find	out	where	they	can	buy	medicine	than	it	is	to	persuade	them	that	medicine	is
good	for	their	health.	It	seems	obvious	that	the	promise	of	scale	is	a	red	herring,	but	ICT4D	proponents	rely
—consciously	or	otherwise—on	it	in	order	to	promote	their	solutions.
Estimates	of	annual,	worldwide	ICT4D	expenditure	are	hard	to	come	by,	but	they	range	from	hundreds	of
millions	to	tens	of	billions	of	U.S.	dollars,	depending	on	what	is	counted.	Given	the	extent	of	the
investment,	the	opportunity	costs	become	significant.	OLPC’s	target	cost	of	a	hundred	dollars	or	less	per
laptop	(in	practice,	the	machines	have	been	more	expensive),	sounds	affordable,	but	that’s	about	half	of
India’s	per-student	education	budget,	most	of	which	is	currently	devoted	to	teachers’	salaries.	Does	a
hundred	dollars	for	a	computer	make	sense	when	$0.50	per	year,	per	child	for	de-worming	pills	could
reduce	the	incidence	of	illness-causing	parasites	and	increase	school	attendance	by	25	percent?
Despite	critical	needs	in	all	areas	of	development,	ICT4D	proponents	tend	not	only	to	ignore	the
opportunity	costs	of	technology,	but	also	to	press	for	funding	from	budgets	allocated	to	non-technology
purposes.	Presumably,	this	was	one	of	the	reasons	behind	OLPC’s	brazen	doublespeak	in	claiming	to	be	“an
education	project,	not	a	laptop	project,”	while	expecting	governments	to	spend	$100	million	for	a	million
laptops,	the	original	minimum	order.	In	a	fine	example	of	the	skewed	priorities	of	ICT4D	boosters,
Hamadoun	Touré,	secretary-general	of	the	International	Telecommunications	Union,	suggests,
“[governments	should]	regard	the	Internet	as	basic	infrastructure—just	like	roads,	waste	and	water.”	Of
course,	in	conditions	of	extreme	poverty,	investments	to	provide	broad	access	to	the	Web	will	necessarily
compete	with	spending	on	proper	sanitation	and	the	rudiments	of	transportation.
When	a	village	has	ready	access	to	a	PC,	the	dominant	use	is
by	young	men	playing	games,	watching	movies,	or	consuming
adult	content.
Disseminating	a	technology	would	work	if,	somehow,	the	technology	did	more	for	the	poor,	undereducated,
and	powerless	than	it	did	for	the	rich,	well-educated,	and	mighty.	But	the	theory	of	technology-as-magnifier
leads	to	the	opposite	conclusion:	the	greater	one’s	capacity,	the	more	technology	delivers;	the	lesser	one’s
capacity,	the	less	value	technology	has.	In	effect,	technology	helps	the	rich	get	richer	while	doing	little	for
the	incomes	of	the	poor,	thus	widening	the	gaps	between	haves	and	have-nots.
Technology	widens	the	gap	through	three	mechanisms.	First,	differential	access.	Technology	is	consistently
more	accessible	to	the	rich	and	the	powerful.	Technology	costs	money	not	only	to	acquire,	but	also	to
more	accessible	to	the	rich	and	the	powerful.	Technology	costs	money	not	only	to	acquire,	but	also	to
operate,	maintain,	and	upgrade.	And	this	“digital	divide”	persists	even	when	the	technology	is	fully
sponsored.	For	instance,	most	public	libraries	in	the	United	States	provide	free	access	to	the	Internet,	but
poorer	residents	have	less	leisure	time	in	which	to	visit	them	and	a	harder	time	reaching	them	because	of
transportation	costs.	There	may	be	social	barriers,	too:	many	of	the	rural	telecenters	I’ve	visited	in	the
developing	world	were	not	accessible	to	the	least	privileged	people	in	their	villages	due	to	social	injunctions
against	comingling	of	caste,	tribe,	or	gender.
Technology	producers	also	reinforce	the	digital	divide.	As	for-profit	companies,	by	and	large,	they	naturally
cater	their	products	toward	larger	groups	of	richer	customers,	who	are	more	likely	to	buy.	Technology
amplifies	shareholder	interest	in	profit,	and,	globally,	this	means	hardware	tends	to	be	designed	for	people
working	in	climate-controlled	offices	with	stable	AC	power;	software	tends	to	be	developed	in	languages
understood	by	the	world’s	largest,	wealthiest	populations;	and	content	tends	to	be	written	for	audiences
with	the	greatest	disposable	income.	Even	when	products	appear	to	be	free,	as	with	TV	or	Google,	they	are
frequently	supported	by	advertisers	who	seek	consumers	with	more	disposable	income.	The	result	is,	again,
that	the	disadvantaged	are	further	disadvantaged.	India	has	more	than	twenty	nationally	recognized
languages,	yet	almost	all	of	the	software	in	use	there	is	in	English,	making	it	difficult	for	those	literate	only
in	their	local	languages	to	use	computers.	And	this	inclination	reinforces	itself:	if	a	technology	is	not
designed	for	someone,	she	won’t	buy	it;	and	if	she	doesn’t	buy	it,	the	producers	won’t	design	for	her.
It	is	possible	to	fight	against	this	differential	access.	Telecenter	projects,	in	fact,	typify	such	efforts,	as	the
centers	are	always	targeted	at	poorer	clients.	But	progressive	practices	with	respect	to	technology	are	not
particularly	effective	on	their	own	because	of	other	differentials	that	technology	doesn’t	undo.	A	level
playing	field	doesn’t	address	the	underlying	issues,	which	are	the	inequalities	among	the	players
themselves.
This	brings	us	to	the	second	mechanism:	even	if	differential	access	to	technology	could	be	countered
through	universally	distributed	technology,	differential	capacity—in	terms	of	education,	social	skills,	or
social	connections—remains.	Consider	the	following	thought	experiment.	You	and	a	poor	farmer	from	a
remote	village	are	each	given	24	hours	to	raise	as	much	money	as	you	can	for	the	charity	of	your	choice.	You
are	both	provided	unfettered	access	to	an	Internet-connected	PC,	and	nothing	else,	with	which	to	fulfill	the
task.	Who	would	be	able	to	raise	more	money?	You	would,	because	of	your	education,	social	ties,	self-
confidence,	and	organizational	capacities.	The	technology	is	exactly	the	same	in	both	cases,	so	the
difference	is	due	to	qualities	associated	with	the	person.	It	could	be	argued	that	telecenter	projects	are	not
far	off	from	a	real-life	version	of	this	experiment.	Clients	of	telecenters	are	limited	in	literacy,	education,
social	ties,	political	influence,	etc.,	and	are	therefore	constrained	in	the	value	they	can	extract	from	the
Internet.	With	limited	capacity,	technology’s	value	is	minimal.
Along	with	differential	access	and	capacity,	a	third	mechanism—differential	motivation—contributes	to	the
widening	divergence	between	the	privileged	and	the	marginalized.	What	do	people	want	to	do	with	the
technology	they	have	access	to?	Those	of	us	who	have	worked	in	interventionist	ICT4D	have	often	been
surprised	to	find	that	poor	people	don’t	rush	to	gain	more	education,	learn	about	health	practices,	or
upgrade	vocational	skills.	Instead,	they	seem	to	use	technology	primarily	for	entertainment.	Telecenter
surveys	find	that	when	a	village	has	ready	access	to	a	PC—connected	to	the	Internet	or	otherwise—the
dominant	use	is	by	young	men	playing	games,	watching	movies,	or	consuming	adult	content.	Many	become
proficient	at	the	software	incantations	required	to	download	YouTube	videos	from	a	PC	onto	a	mobile
phone.	But	these	same	users	typically	forsake	software-based	accounting	and	language	lessons.	What
interventionists	perceive	to	be	“productive”	use	of	technology	is	trumped	by	the	“frivolous”	desires	of	users.
Even	users	in	the	developed	world	rarely	take	advantage	of	their	technologies	for	purposes	of	self-
improvement—the	most	popular	iPhone	apps	are	games	and	other	entertainments,	nothing	that	would
improve	productivity	or	health—but	this	tendency	is	exacerbated	among	those	who	have	grown	up	with
lessons	of	learned	helplessness	and	low	self-confidence.
I’m	not	blaming	the	victim.	None	of	the	three	mechanisms	necessarily	speak	to	failures	on	the	part	of	those
who	are	poor	or	poorly	educated.	Blame,	if	it	must	be	attributed,	falls	readily	on	historical	circumstances,
social	structures,	and	the	rich	world’s	unwillingness	to	invest	in	high-quality,	universal	education.	In	fact,
one	reason	for	valuing	education	is	that	it	generates	the	appetite	for	and	capacity	to	use	modern	tools—all
the	more	reason	to	focus	on	nurturing	human	capability,	rather	than	trying	to	compensate	for	limited
capacity	with	technology.

The	problem	is	that	ICT4D	assumes	the	very	results	it	seeks	to	achieve.	The	human	intent	and	competence
ICT4D	aims	to	generate	must	already	be	in	place	for	the	technology	to	work.	But	if	developing	economies
had	the	capacity,	there	would	be	no	need	for	an	external	technology	push:	capable	people	attract,	or
develop,	their	own	technology.
North	America,	Western	Europe,	Japan,	and	several	other	economically	blessed	regions	are	cases	in	point.
They	attained	their	status	as	economic	powerhouses	well	before	digital	technologies	had	a	measurable
impact	of	any	kind.	Their	advanced	production	and	consumption	of	information	technology	can	be
interpreted	more	as	a	result	of	economic	advances	than	as	a	primary	cause.
Computers,	guns,	factories,	and	democracy	are	powerful	tools,
but	the	forces	that	determine	how	they’re	used	ultimately	are
human.
There	is	also	evidence	that	previous	applications	of	information	and	communications	technology	in
developing	countries	have	not	led	directly	to	socioeconomic	progress.	Consider	television.	In	1964	Wilbur
Schramm,	the	father	of	communications	studies	and	a	cofounder	of	Stanford	University’s	Department	of
Communication,	wrote	a	book	eerily	prescient	of	ICT4D	discourse,	though	its	focus	was	on	the	technologies
of	its	day—print,	radio,	and	television.	In	one	section	of	Mass	Media	and	National	Development,	Schramm
highlights	the	potential	of	television:
What	if	the	full	power	and	vividness	of	television	teaching	were	to	be	used	to	help	the	schools	develop	a	country’s	new
educational	pattern?	What	if	the	full	persuasive	and	instructional	power	of	television	were	to	be	used	in	support	of
community	development	and	the	modernization	of	farming?
Since	then	television	has	had	some	positive	impact.	Economists	Robert	Jensen	and	Emily	Oster	have	found
that	exposure	to	cable	television	empowers	rural	women	in	India.	Anthropological	evidence	suggests	that
television	shows	depicting	urban	values	can	shift	social	attitudes	in	rural	areas.	One	nonprofit	organization,
the	Population	Media	Center,	explicitly	applies	this	principle	in	order	to	influence	birth	rates	and	health-
care	practices	in	developing	countries	by	running	soap	operas	with	positive	social	messaging.	These	are
care	practices	in	developing	countries	by	running	soap	operas	with	positive	social	messaging.	These	are
encouraging	points.
Yet	the	sum	total	of	television’s	development	impact	comes	nowhere	near	even	Schramm’s	measured
expectations.	Half	a	century	later,	we	find	that	television	has	not	been	consistently	beneficial	to	national
education	or	agriculture,	either	in	the	developed	or	the	developing	world.	A	visit	to	a	poor	household	with	a
television	suggests	how	appropriate	the	“boob	tube”	nickname	really	is.	TV	is	not	an	effective	guard	against
illiteracy,	poverty,	or	poor	health,	as	India,	where	about	half	of	households	own	TVs,	demonstrates.
Whatever	television’s	potential,	society—both	as	producer	and	consumer	of	technology—has	failed	to	apply
it	consistently	toward	development	on	a	large	scale.
My	point	is	not	that	technology	is	useless.	To	the	extent	that	we	are	willing	and	able	to	put	technology	to
positive	ends,	it	has	a	positive	effect.	For	example,	Digital	Green	(DG),	one	of	the	most	successful	ICT4D
projects	I	oversaw	while	at	Microsoft	Research,	promotes	the	use	of	locally	recorded	how-to	videos	to	teach
smallholder	farmers	more	productive	practices.	When	it	comes	to	persuading	farmers	to	adopt	good
practices,	DG	is	ten	times	more	cost-effective	than	classical	agriculture	extension	without	technology.
But	the	value	of	a	technology	remains	contingent	on	the	motivations	and	abilities	of	organizations	applying
it—villagers	must	be	organized,	content	must	be	produced,	and	instructors	must	be	trained.	The	limiting
factor	in	spreading	DG’s	impact	is	not	how	many	camcorders	its	organizers	can	purchase	or	how	many
videos	they	can	shoot,	but	how	many	groups	are	performing	good	agriculture	extension	in	the	first	place.
Where	such	organizations	are	few,	building	institutional	capacity	is	the	more	difficult,	but	necessary,
condition	for	DG’s	technology	to	have	value.	In	other	words,	disseminating	technology	is	easy;	nurturing
human	capacity	and	human	institutions	that	put	it	to	good	use	is	the	crux.
The	claim	that	technology	is	only	a	magnifier	extends	beyond	international	development	and	beyond
information	and	communication	technology.	Nobody	expects	to	turn	around	a	loss-making	company	with
the	injection	of	newer	computers,	but	well-run	corporations	can	benefit	from,	say,	computerized	supply
chains.	A	gun	in	the	right	hands	protects	citizens	and	maintains	peace;	in	the	wrong	hands,	it	kills	and
oppresses.	(Alas,	the	gun	lobby	is	right—“guns	don’t	kill	people;	people	kill	people.”)	Modern	industrial
technology	magnifies	our	ability	to	produce,	but	it	also	magnifies	our	desire	to	consume.	On	a	planet	with
finite	resources,	the	latter	could	be	our	ruin.	And	history	suggests	that	even	the	political	“technology”	of
democracy	is	all-too	easily	subverted	in	the	absence	of	an	educated,	self-confident	citizenry,	willing	and	able
to	implement	checks	and	balances	against	the	abuse	of	power.	Computers,	guns,	factories,	and	democracy
are	powerful	tools,	but	the	forces	that	determine	how	they’re	used	ultimately	are	human.
This	point	seems	obvious	but	is	forgotten	in	the	rush	to	scale.	Currently	the	international-development
community	is	having	a	love	affair	with	the	mobile	phone.	Rigorously	executed	research	by	Jensen	and	by
fellow	economist	Jenny	C.	Aker	demonstrates	that	cell	phones	can	eliminate	certain	kinds	of	information
inefficiencies	in	developing-world	markets.	Encouraged	by	such	findings	and	by	the	sheer	depth	of	mobile-
phone	penetration,	foundations	and	multilateral	agencies	have	formed	task	forces	and	entire	departments
devoted	to	mobile	phones	for	international	development.	In	these	circles,	it	is	not	possible	to	discuss
microfinance	without	“mobile	money,”	or	health	care	without	“mHealth”	(short	for	“mobile	health”).
The	magnification	thesis,	however,	suggests	that	this	is	a	one-sided	view	of	mobile	phones.	Certainly	talking
is	something	that	all	human	beings,	as	social	animals,	not	only	want	to	do,	but	are	well	equipped	for.
Phones	multiply	that	intent	and	capacity,	and	some	of	the	resulting	value	is	positive—no	point	in	being	an
indiscriminate	Luddite.
But,	it’s	not	just	productive	intentions	that	are	magnified	by	technology.	When	a	dollar-a-day	rickshaw
puller	pays	a	large	corporation	for	the	privilege	of	changing	his	ring	tone,	does	he	generate	a	net	benefit	to
puller	pays	a	large	corporation	for	the	privilege	of	changing	his	ring	tone,	does	he	generate	a	net	benefit	to
himself	or	society?	Companies	pump	out	such	questionable,	“value-added”	services,	and	millions	of
impoverished	consumers	readily	pay	for	them.	Kathleen	Diga	of	the	University	of	KwaZulu	Natal	observed
that	some	households	in	Uganda	prioritize	talk	time	over	family	nutrition	and	clean	water.	Sociologist
Jenna	Burrell	found	that	destructive	patterns	of	gender	politics	are	exacerbated	by	mobile	phones,	as	men
wield	phones	as	tools	of	sexual	exchange.	Meanwhile,	in	the	developed	world,	there	is	mounting	evidence
that	mobile	phones	contribute	to	distracted	driving,	fractured	attention,	and	reduced	cognitive	ability.
We	are	in	the	midst	of	the	largest	ICT4D	experiment	ever.	In	2009	there	were	over	4.5	billion	active	mobile
phone	accounts,	more	than	the	entire	population	of	the	world	older	than	twenty	years	of	age.	The	cell	phone
is	overtaking	both	television	and	radio	as	the	most	popular	consumer	electronic	device	in	history.	Some	80
percent	of	the	global	population	is	within	range	of	a	cell	tower,	and	mobile	phones	are	increasingly	seen	in
the	poorest,	remotest	communities.
These	numbers	prompt	suggestions	that	there	is	no	longer	a	“digital	divide”	for	real-time	communication.
Yet	any	demographic	account	of	mobile	have-nots	will	show	them	to	be	predominantly	poor,	remote,
female,	and	politically	mute.	Whatever	the	case,	if	the	spread	of	mobile	phones	is	sufficient	to	help	end
global	poverty,	we	will	know	soon	enough.	But,	if	it	doesn’t,	should	we	then	pin	our	hopes	on	the	next	new
shiny	gadget?
