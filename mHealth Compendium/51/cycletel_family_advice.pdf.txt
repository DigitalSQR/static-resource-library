CYCLETEL Family Advice & CYCLETEL Humsafar 
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  CycleTel Family Advice–March 2015 to Present; CycleTel Humsafar–2011 to Present 
Bridging the gap between family planning knowledge and behavior
Does fertility awareness and family planning information impact attitudes and behaviors around family 
planning? Could knowledge increase the likelihood of family planning method uptake? Georgetown 
University’s Institute for Reproductive Health (IRH) has developed a two-part service to answer this 
question. The first service, CycleTel Family Advice, is a series of 65 educational short message service 
(SMS) texts on fertility, family planning, couples communication, and related topics. Messages are written 
as conversational stories and targeted by age, sex, and marital status. CycleTel Family Advice users can 
also access the second service, CycleTel Humsafar, a family planning method directly on their phone. 
Based on the Standard Days Method® (SDM), CycleTel Humsafar helps a woman identify which 
days during her menstrual cycle she is most likely to become pregnant and alerts her on fertile days. 
IRH, in partnership with others, has followed a step-wise, systematic approach to CycleTel Humsafar 
development and pilot testing since 2010. Under the US Agency for International Development-funded 
FACT Project (2013-18), IRH and partners were able to design and develop the CycleTel Family Advice 
Service, and offer it at scale in India through a private sector partnership. Both services were made 
available to users starting in early 2015 and will be evaluated for behavioral outcomes.
