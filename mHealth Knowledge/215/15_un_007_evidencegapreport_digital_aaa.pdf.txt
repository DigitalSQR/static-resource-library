these trends toward closing the gaps in the evidence, as the evidence base supporting mhealth is 
however, are gradually emerging and therefore are not underdeveloped and young, the global health community

methodologies such as randomization, collecting baseline

can have multiple meanings, depending upon who is 
baCkGrOUnd using it . for the purpose of this report, the following 
factors contribute to a “rigorous” study: 
mobile technology, particularly mobile telecommunication 
technology, is increasingly becoming an important tool  1 . Clear and full documentation of the study design, 
in global health programs . excitement about the potential including limitations and rationale for the study design; 
of what has become known as “mhealth”3 centers

addressing the social determinants of health and 
how social marginalization leads to health inequities has 
become a priority topic in the global health community .134 
the literature review revealed an emerging evidence base 
on how mhealth may be utilized as a tool for working with 
marginalized or particularly vulnerable populations . Some 
of the grey literature addressed the social determinants 
and constructs that serve as obstacles to using mhealth . 
in the field of mnch and mhealth, gender power 
dynamics that contribute to inequities are being addressed 
by the mhealth alliance and by initiatives such as gSma’s 
mwomen Program .135
despite the global consensus around the role that social 
determinants play in contributing to health inequities and 
the emerging attention in the literature to how mhealth 
can influence social determinants, the evidence base for 
using mhealth to reduce health inequities is still nascent . 
in light of the recognized role that social and economic 
marginalization play in accessing health services, the lack 
of a strong evidence base analyzing how mhealth might 
impact health inequities should be considered a gap 
warranting further research .
