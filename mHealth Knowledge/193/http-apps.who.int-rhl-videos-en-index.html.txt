WHO recommendations: non-clinical interventions to reduce unnecessary caesarean sections
Caesarean section rates have been steadily increasing worldwide over the last few decades above levels that cannot be considered medically necessary. This trend has not been accompanied by significant maternal or perinatal benefits. In recognition of the urgent need to address this sustained and unprecedented rise in the use of caesarean section, WHO has produced evidence-based guidance on non-clinical interventions specifically designed to reduce unnecessary caesarean section. These recommendations can be useful to health-care professionals responsible for developing regional, national and local health protocols and policies, as well as obstetricians, midwives, nurses, general medical practitioners, managers of maternal and child health programmes, and public health policy-makers in all settings and countries where increasing use of caesarean section has been identified as a problem.
