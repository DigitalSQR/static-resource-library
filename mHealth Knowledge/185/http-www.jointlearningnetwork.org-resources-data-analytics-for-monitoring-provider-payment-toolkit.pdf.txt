Using	Data	Analytics	to	Monitor	Health	Provider	Payment	Systems
A	carefully	developed	provider	payment	system	can	be	a	powerful	instrument	for	making	progress	toward	universal	health	coverage.	Effectively
monitoring	this	system	is	an	integral	part	of	the	process.		Countries	can	draw	on	the	collective	experience	presented	in	this	toolkit	to	create	an
effective	provider	payment	monitoring	system	that	generates	information	on	an	ongoing	basis	about	whether	objectives	are	being	met	or
unintended	consequences	are	emerging.
	
Six	of	the	tools	within	the	toolkit	have	been	developed	such	that	they	can	be	modified	to	fit	the	country’s	specific	context.		Links	to	download
these	tools	are	found	below:
