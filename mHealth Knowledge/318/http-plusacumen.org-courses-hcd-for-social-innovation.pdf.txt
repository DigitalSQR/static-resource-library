talk to people and test your ideas.

person. Need to find team
members? You can post to the
discussion forums a month
before the course starts.
Platform: NovoEd (+Acumen
developed the course. We host
this course on the NovoEd
platform.)
Timing: This course will be open
for 9 weeks. You can work
through the materials at your
own pace during the time the
course is open. There are no
required times for you to log in.
There will be suggested
deadlines for you to complete
each assignment. The
final deadline is the final day of
the course.
