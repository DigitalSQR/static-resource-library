The	primary	function	of	a	health	information	system	in	a	country	is	to	collect	and
analyze	data	in	order	to	help	providers	and	policymakers	improve	patient	care	and
make	decisions	about	what	are	the	population’s	most	important	health	needs	and	how
to	address	them.
The	field	is	now	demanding	evidence	of	progress	and	accountability	for	health
systems.	The	Millennium	Development	Goals,	the	more	recent	Sustainable
Development	Goals,	and	many	health	initiatives—including	the	President’s	Emergency
Plan	for	AIDS	Relief	(PEPFAR)—are	driving	attention	on	strengthening	health
information	systems	(HIS)	to	produce	that	evidence.	Country	health	information
systems	are	key	because	data	from	different	sources	are	the	best	means	to	fill	the
large	number	of	information	needs	to	demonstrate	progress	and	accountability.
MEASURE	Evaluation	works	where	the	focus	on	data-driven	evidence	intersects	with
the	capabilities	of	health	information	systems	in	low-resource	countries.	MEASURE
Evaluation	is	a	USAID-funded	project	with	a	mandate	to	strengthen	health	information
systems	and,	moreover,	to	share	what	we	are	learning	as	we	go.
Our	focus	is	in	lower-	and	middle-income	countries	where	the	environments	are
challenging.	Some	of	these	countries	don’t	have	sufficient	resources	to	fund	robust
routine	health	information	systems	or	to	maintain	civil	registration	and	vital	statistic
registries	for	generating	data.	They	often	rely	on	donors	to	fund	and	carry	out
population	surveys,	conduct	research,	and	establish	data	systems.	More	often	than
not,	these	data	systems	are	implemented	to	bypass	weak	government	resources	and
to	meet	the	donors’	needs	for	reporting	on	indicators	and	targets.	But	these	work-
arounds	have	meant	slow	improvements	for	a	country’s	own	systems.
So	the	question	becomes,	what	interventions	work	to	strengthen	a	country’s	health
information	systems	so	they	improve	the	functioning	of	the	country’s	overall	health
system	and,	at	the	same	time,	provide	data	that	satisfy	the	need	for	donors	to	report
on	international	goals?
At	MEASURE	Evaluation,	we
have	articulated	three
questions	to	answer	that	big
one:	(1)	What	are	the	factors
and	conditions	that	indicate
progress	to	improve	health
information	systems?	(2)	What
are	the	stages	of	that
progression	to	a	strong	HIS,
and	how	are	they	measured?	(3)	What	are	the	characteristics	of	a	strong	health
information	system?
As	we	answer	those	questions,	we	are	engaging	other	interested	parties	to	share
insights	and	information.	With	input	from	many	quarters,	we	expect	to	learn	more,
faster.	Here’s	how	we’re	working	and	how	you	might	help:
We	are	working	to	create	resources	to	facilitate	learning	exchange.	I	hope	you’ll
check	out	the	HIS	Strengthening	Resource	Center	at
http://www.measureevaluation.org/his-strengthening-resource-center.
We	are	working	to	break	out	of	our	specialized	“silos”	and,	in	an	iterative	fashion,
share	what	we	are	learning	and	critically	assess	the	gaps	we	can	identify.
We	support	rigorous	evaluation	of	HIS	strengthening	activities	(such	as	an
evaluation	of	an	electronic	health	record	implementation	in	Swaziland)	and
syntheses	of	literature	and	case	studies	of	investments	in	HIS	strengthening.
The	HIS	Strengthening	Resource	Center 	also	is	a	hub	for	that	hoped-for
learning	exchange.	It	shows	the	current	status	of	health	information	systems	in
lower-	and	middle-income	countries;	it	has	a	model	for	HIS	strengthening	to
facilitate	a	shared	vision	and	lexicon;	and	it	features	tools	and	resources	to
improve	measurement—including	performance	indicators	and	methods.	This	is	a
work	in	progress,	and	the	more	others	use	it	and	provide	feedback,	the	stronger	it
will	become.
We	have	an	inter-partner	technical	advisory	group	that	provides	input	to
documents	and	the	strategic	direction	for	our	learning	and	for	the	HIS
Strengthening	Resource	Center.
How	can	you	take	advantage	now	of	what	we’re	learning?	You	can	access	the	HIS
Strengthening	Resource	Center	for	its	changing	compilation	of	country	profiles,	HIS
resources,	indicators,	tools,	a	bibliography	of	relevant	materials,	and	a	model	of	HIS
strengthening.	There,	you’ll	also	find	a	place	to	leave	comments	and	questions.	And,
please	check	back	as	we	will	continue	to	update	this	resource	center.

Quite	an	interesting	article	on	HIS	and	the	critical	questions	asked.	Often	as	low	and	middle	income
countries	our	data	or	HIS	are	donor	driven	and	the	indicators	collected	both	at	regional	and	national
level	mostly	what	donors	require	from	us.
Hence	we	forget	to	collect	information	that	will	inform	us	(countries)	in	strengthening	programming
and	improving	our	stragetic	interventions.
Please	share	the	evaluation	report	on	HIS	in	Swaziland.	It	would	be	interesting	to	find	out	how	best
we	can	improve	our	own(	recommendations	)
Thanking	you	inadvance

Threw	good	questions.
As	a	provider	of.HIS	services	in	the	Africa	market,	I’m	of	the	opinion	that	the	hype	is	real	and	reality
not	hyped.	We.need	to	hype	the	reality	–	which	is	few	governments	have	the	capacity	to	procure
systems.	The	process.in	place	favor	expenditure	on	commodities,	training	and	logistics.	The	M&E
INDUSTRY	is	not	investing	in	systems	but	in	survey	tools.	So	we	have	a	long	way	to	go	for	the	hype
tof	match	reality.
