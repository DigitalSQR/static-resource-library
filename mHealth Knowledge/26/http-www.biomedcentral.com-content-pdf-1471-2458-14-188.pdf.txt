work and why of implementation of mobile
health (mHealth) projects in Africa
Clara B Aranda-Jan1†, Neo Mohutsiwa-Dibe2† and Svetla Loukanova2*Abstract
Background: Access to mobile phone technology has rapidly expanded in developing countries. In Africa, mHealth
is a relatively new concept and questions arise regarding reliability of the technology used for health outcomes.
This review documents strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of mHealth projects in Africa.
Methods: A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature on mHealth projects in Africa, between 2003 and 2013,
was carried out using PubMed and OvidSP. Data was synthesized using a SWOT analysis methodology. Results were
grouped to assess specific aspects of project implementation in terms of sustainability and mid/long-term results,
integration to the health system, management process, scale-up and replication, and legal issues, regulations and
standards.
Results: Forty-four studies on mHealth projects in Africa were included and classified as: “patient follow-up and
medication adherence” (n = 19), “staff training, support and motivation” (n = 2), “staff evaluation, monitoring and
guidelines compliance” (n = 4), “drug supply-chain and stock management” (n = 2), “patient education and
awareness” (n = 1), “disease surveillance and intervention monitoring” (n = 4), “data collection/transfer and reporting”
(n = 10) and “overview of mHealth projects” (n = 2). In general, mHealth projects demonstrate positive health-related
outcomes and their success is based on the accessibility, acceptance and low-cost of the technology, effective
adaptation to local contexts, strong stakeholder collaboration, and government involvement. Threats such as
dependency on funding, unclear healthcare system responsibilities, unreliable infrastructure and lack of evidence
on cost-effectiveness challenge their implementation. mHealth projects can potentially be scaled-up to help tackle
problems faced by healthcare systems like poor management of drug stocks, weak surveillance and reporting
systems or lack of resources.
Conclusions: mHealth in Africa is an innovative approach to delivering health services. In this fast-growing
technological field, research opportunities include assessing implications of scaling-up mHealth projects, evaluating
cost-effectiveness and impacts on the overall health system.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/188Background
According to the International Telecommunication Union
(ITU), mobile-phone subscriptions reached almost 6 bil-
lion globally in 2011, driven mainly by an increase of
subscribers from developing countries which added more
than 80% of the 660 million new subscriptions during that
year [1]. By 2013, global penetration of mobile phones is
estimated to reach over 95% of the population worldwide
[2], which means that more people will have access to mo-
bile phones than to water and sanitation services [3]. This
shows the large and rapid expansion of mobile phone
ownership in the developing world.
Mobile health (mHealth) is a component of electronic
health (eHealth). Though not a standardized definition,
mHealth refers to the use of mobile communication tech-
nologies to promote health by supporting healthcare prac-
tices (e.g. health data collection, delivery of healthcare
information, or patient observation and provision of care)
[4,5]. This technology has erupted rapidly and, conse-
quently, the benefits and limitations for healthcare are still
not well understood.
In developing countries, decreasing costs and increasing
network coverage provide a wide range of opportunities
for applications using mobile phones and other telecom-
munication technologies. These opportunities can also be
extended to the utilization mHealth technologies in
healthcare [6]. The use of mHealth services can have the
potential to improve affordability of interventions for
health promotion, increase health education and disease
prevention [7-10]. Mitchell et al. [11] suggest that port-
ability, the “always on” status, and data transmission are
the qualities of mobile phones that have made them reach
a larger population than computers and the internet.
Moreover, telecommunication technologies may also re-
duce time, distance and cost of information delivery, and
support health providers to offer cost-effective services
[3]. In developing countries, mHealth could offer solutions
for healthcare systems challenged by inadequate finances,
poor health information systems, scarce resources and
limited trained staff, particularly in countries with a rapid-
growing number of mobile phone subscriptions [12]. The
present study looks at mHealth as the use of mobile
phone technology to enable provision of healthcare ser-
vices in Africa.
The main objective of this study is to analyze the
experiences of mHealth implementations in Africa
during the last decade, and to identify factors influen-
cing the successes and failures of mHealth projects in
Africa using a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, oppor-
tunities and threats) analysis. Our specific research
questions are:
a) What are the factors leading to successful
implementation of mHealth projects?b) What are the factors limiting or challenging the
implementation of mHealth projects?
c) Why do these factors cause project failure or limit
project implementation?
Through answering these research questions we aim
to gain a better understanding of the current situation of
mHealth projects in Africa, develop recommendations
based on these findings and identify areas were further
research is needed.
Significance of this study
mHealth is an emerging topic and most projects have re-
cently been implemented, or are in a pilot stage. Therefore,
their duration is too short to be able to accurately measure
their impacts [8]. The absence of such information may
hinder efforts to understand limitations, challenges and
reasons for success of mHealth projects. By documenting
and assessing experiences, we aim to inform on the issues
faced during mHealth project implementation.
Methods
Literature search strategy and criteria for study selection
An electronic systematic literature search was conducted
using PubMed and Journal @Ovid. Two search strategies
were used: the first one combined the MESH terms
“mHealth” AND “Africa”, and the second search com-
bined the free-text words “mobile phone$ or cellphone$”
AND “health” AND “Africa”. The searches were limited
to articles published in English during the period be-
tween 2003-2013. The searches were performed in June
2013 by two authors (CAJ and SL). All duplicated articles
were removed automatically using Endnote and a manual
revision was done for verification (CAJ). From the total
search results, all potential abstracts were screened and
studies were selected for full-text review (CAJ and NMD).
Full-text articles were searched manually in digital sources
and studies were excluded when access to full-text articles
was not available. To avoid selection bias, the three au-
thors carried out the full-text article review and any differ-
ence in the selection was discussed and papers selected
accordingly. Exclusion criteria were: Project not located in
Africa, non-mHealth implementation (telemedicine, other
types of eHealth and use of other telecommunication
technologies, such computers, internet or e-mail), and
studies on factors associated to mobile phones but not
mHealth implementation (e.g. community ownership or
acceptability of mobile phones). Except for project proto-
cols, all study designs (randomized-control trials [RCTs],
pilot project, literature reviews etc.) were included.
Data collection and analysis
Based on the research questions and objectives, data
from full text articles was summarized, extracted and
Aranda-Jan et al. BMC Public Health 2014, 14:188 Page 3 of 15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/188collected manually in a table format in four main groups:
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT).
The rationale behind the use of a SWOT analysis is that it
allows identifying internal and external factors influencing
the performance of a project. This SWOT-type analysis is
particularly useful for strategic project planning and has
been widely used in management and policy research, as
well as being one of the main tools used to inform
decision-makers about effectiveness of projects [13]. For
these reasons, we considered it to be an adequate tool to
strategically assess implementations of mHealth projects.
Considering the objectives of the present analysis, each
SWOTgroup refers to:
 Strengths: internal factors referring to outcomes,
project drivers, reasons for success.
 Weaknesses: internal factors referring to project
limitations and challenges.
 Opportunities: external factors such as areas of
potential for mHealth implementation, facilitators of
mHealth projects, etc.
 Threats: external factors such as potential for failure,
external barriers and limitations.
Articles included after the full-text review were analyzed
according to these indicators and findings were compiled
in a SWOT table into six different areas of project imple-
mentation (Table 1):
 Project sustainability: mid- and long term results
and impacts.
 Project integration into the health system: relevance
of the design, involvement of key stakeholders,
compatibility to existing government policies and
management information systems.
 Technology/existing infrastructure: cost, usage and
acceptance, network coverage, electricity and other
infrastructure.
 Project management process: related resources
required for project implementation.
 Scale-up and replication: requirements for scaling-
up projects at a regional or national level.
 Legal issues, regulations and standards: in-country
regulations, laws or standards that influence
mHealth projects.
Results and discussion
From a total of 464 search results, 81 studies were selected
for full-text review of which 44 studies, published between
2006 and 2013, were included in the review according to
the inclusion criteria. These studies include 19 pilot
studies, 11 randomized-control trials, 4 mixed methods
studies, 3 cross-sectional studies, 2 cohort studies, 1 quali-
tative study (interviews), 2 literature reviews, and 2 cost-analysis studies. Most of the mHealth projects focused on
HIV, malaria, tuberculosis (TB), diabetes and antenatal
care. Further screening allowed their classification into
topics according to mHealth benefits and types of inter-
vention into: “patient follow-up and medication adher-
ence” (n = 19), “staff training, support and motivation”
(n = 2), “staff evaluation, monitoring and guidelines com-
pliance” (n = 4), “drug supply-chain and stock manage-
ment” (n = 2), “patient education and awareness” (n = 1),
“disease surveillance and intervention monitoring” (n = 4),
“data collection/transfer and reporting” (n = 10) and “over-
view of mHealth projects” (N = 2). When a project fell into
two or more of these topics, the authors selected the most
fitting and classified the project as such. Figure 1 presents
a flowchart detailing the inclusion/exclusion process.
Most projects were pilot studies or RCT studies imple-
mented at community levels and not yet scaled-up to
larger levels, thus evidence presented on effectiveness is
limited and long-term results are unclear. Nonetheless,
findings show the feasibility and potential of these pro-
jects to support healthcare systems in Africa. The fol-
lowing sections will, firstly, discuss the findings on each
topic (except “overview of mHealth projects”, included
in the SWOT discussion) and, secondly, present the re-
sults of the SWOT analysis of each aspect of project
implementation.
Patient follow-up and medication adherence
Implementations to improve patient life-style and medica-
tion adherence, and treatment follow-up were the most
common among the findings of the review (n = 19). Six
studies were results from pilot projects to inform birth
outcomes [14], report drugs’ secondary effects [15],
follow-up children’s vaccinations [16], monitor patients
with TB [17], observe of diabetic patients’ behavioral
change [18] and identify pregnant women needing ante-
natal care and referral services [19]. RCT studies were also
common in this topic (n = 8), showing results on ART
monitoring and patient adherence [20-26] and skilled de-
livery attendance [27]. SMS, video messages (MMS) and
phone calls were used on these projects. Other findings
included a cross-sectional study exploring the feasibility of
using mobile phones for sending reminders to patients
regarding their medications and appointments in an anti-
retroviral treatment (ART) health facility [28], a review to
determine effectiveness of SMS on patient adherence to
ART [29], a cohort study to monitor patient adherence to
ART [30], and two mixed-methods studies, one for
supporting patients with breast cancer during their
oncological treatment [31] and a second one to monitor
adherence to treatment and care provided by caregivers
of HIV-infected children [32].
When comparing pilot projects to RCTs, outcomes are
not always consistent. Pilot projects tend to report

and mid/long-term results, integration of the project to the health system, technology and infrastructure, project management process, scale-up and replication, and legal, regulatory and standardization aspects. When
more than 3 studies were found to be referring to the same issues, these were embolden to highlight their relevance according to appearance in the studies.

Figure 1 Inclusion/exclusion flowchart.outcomes positively and draw on the high potential for
mHealth to be effective in providing solutions needed in
the healthcare system. RCTs and mixed-methods studies,
on the other hand, differ from these results by reporting
little to no significant effect of the mHealth intervention;
this is particularly true for projects on patient adherence
to ART.
The feasibility and potential of mHealth implementa-
tions for patient adherence to treatment and follow-up
is unanimously agreed upon across the studies. However,
the reproducibility and scalability of these projects is far
from certain. The various studies discuss problems such
as a lack of adjustment to confounding factors [27], small
sample sizes [14,33,34], lack of external validity [27], un-
certainty in data quality [14], and lack of larger RCTs in
the literature[29] as factors that make projects’ outcomes
questionable.Staff training, support and motivation
The lack of trained and qualified health staff is a major
challenge for many African health systems [34,35]. In
Uganda and South Africa, in areas where staff and infra-
structure are limited, the use of mobile phone technolo-
gies by community health workers (CHW) gave positiveresults on HIV-infected patient care [36]. Frequent deliv-
ery of text messages has positively influenced patient
care and logistics, supporting clinic and community
health workers and patients [26,37,38].
Two pilot projects were included that aim to support,
train or provide motivation to healthcare workers or staff
clinicians. A pilot project in Botswana showed that health
workers in remote areas could be linked to specialists to
get advice for making better diagnoses by accessing point-
of-care medical information [33]. The second project
trained community health workers to utilize mobile phones
for reporting on patient adherence, send reminders for ap-
pointments, and answer physician queries [39]. The project
showed that by supporting health workers using mobile
phones the facility’s operational costs and worker-time
were decreased, while capacity of the treatment program
increased. These projects show that mHealth could
benefit developing countries by accessing clinical infor-
mation in rural areas and, transferring clinical data and
build capacity [40-42].Staff evaluation, monitoring and compliance to guidelines
mHealth has also been used for staff evaluation and
performance monitoring [37,43,44] and compliance to
Aranda-Jan et al. BMC Public Health 2014, 14:188 Page 9 of 15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/188treatment guidelines [45]. Studies included three RCTs
and one cost-analysis. In Kenya and Uganda, the use of
SMS reminders helped to improve patient care and had
a positive effect in case management [37,45]. In Kenya,
studies showed that mHealth is a cost-effective tool for
improving quality of treatment and provider perform-
ance with limited resources [43,44]. However, similar to
patients’ adherence, RCTs show surprising results re-
garding health workers’ compliance to guidelines. For in-
stance, Jones et al. [45] conclude that “there is little
information or discussion in [the] literature [of health
workers behavior and adherence to guidelines] on the
drivers of change, the possible mechanisms through
which interventions might be acting in order to bring
about any observed improvements”. Moreover, Chang
et al. [37] warn against over-interpreting positive project
outcomes due to the small sample size and suggest that,
whilst communication between patients and staff im-
proved upon implementation of the project (as did the
quality of care from health workers), the main benefit of
the intervention was the ability to make phone calls
[37]. Additionally, whilst health workers performance
improved, there were no improvements in patient adher-
ence or retention to treatment programs.Drug supply chain and stock management
SMS messaging has also been used to improve drug sup-
ply chain and management. In Kenya and Tanzania, text
messaging has been used as a tool to provide real-time up-
dates on drug stocks in health facilities, reducing out-of-
stocks and supporting drug stock management [46,47].
Both pilot projects show that timely data collection on
drug stock levels improves availability and supply of drugs
to clinics. While these projects show positive results, the
lack of RCTs to assess actual impact of mHealth in drug
stock management was highlighted [46].Disease surveillance and intervention monitoring
The dual burden of rising communicable and non-
communicable diseases in Africa, including chronic non-
communicable diseases increases, challenges the already
over-stretched health systems [48]. Some mHealth pro-
jects have targeted disease surveillance and monitoring to
reduce disease burden. Selected studies included two pilot
projects for malaria reporting [49] and case detection [50],
a cross-sectional study to assess malaria control coverage
and detection of infections nationwide [51] and a cohort
study to improve coverage and scale-up an ART interven-
tion [52]. In Zambia and Uganda, both pilot projects
reported on the feasibility of using SMS reporting for mal-
aria active case detection, disease surveillance and case
identification [50]. Although timely reporting of data was
seen as a positive outcome of the project, the cohort studyin Rwanda concluded that mobile phone data collection
may be logistically complex and time consuming [52].
Data collection/transfer and reporting
In many African countries the quality of health informa-
tion systems tends to be poor due to existent information
systems, data incompleteness, untimeliness and inad-
equate analysis [15]. Mobile phones have been used to
tackle these challenges. In Liberia, training was provided
to low- and non-literate midwives from rural areas on
pregnancy data collection and transmission using mobile
phones [53]; authors demonstrate that overall knowledge
and skills for data transmission to healthcare data are ac-
quired after the training. Arguably, all the studies included
in this review consider some sort of data collection, how-
ever, specific consideration was given here to ten projects
that assess the collection process as a primary outcome of
the research. Five studies were pilot projects [40,54-58],
one was an RCT [38], one a mixed methods approach
[54], one a cross-sectional study [34] and one an analysis
of costs [59]. Use of SMS as a data collection tool was re-
ported as feasible for delivery of information in real time,
to improve information quality, reduce data losses and
reporting errors, and reduce data uploading difficulties
[40,55-58]. However, studies reported several difficulties
such as study methodology limitations, privacy and confi-
dentiality matters, low technology use training and skills,
no increase of efficiency or reliability of the data, unknown
cost-effectiveness, risk of theft, and high implementation
costs [56,60].
Health education and awareness
L’Engle et al. [61] evaluated the provision of automated
family planning information to the general public via mo-
bile phones. While the study concludes that it is feasible
to use mobile phones for health education and awareness
purposes, results showed large underreporting, a risk of
bias (e.g. use of contraceptives prior of the implementa-
tion of the project) and the need to evaluate impacts using
RCTs.
Results from the SWOT analysis
Strengths: what is working?
mHealth projects are highly reliant upon the characteristics
of the technology available. Its low-cost, ease of use and
wide-spread availability were frequently cited as the main
drivers for implementation [18,22,26,43,49,50,56,58,59,
62,63]. An increase in access to mobile phones has moti-
vated researchers and project managers towards seeking
innovative ways in which healthcare can be provided, par-
ticularly in areas that current infrastructure and technolo-
gies cannot possibly reach.
The majority of the projects reported successes and
positive outcomes of mHealth in Africa. Some these
Aranda-Jan et al. BMC Public Health 2014, 14:188 Page 10 of 15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/188results were: support to patients in requesting services
(e.g. generating appointments) [27,34,62], reduction in
communication delays and improvement on data collec-
tion and reporting [14,18,38,46,47,49-51,54,56,63], re-
duction in patient burden to transportation time and
costs [49,51,62], improvement on health workers’ com-
pliance to treatment guidelines [17,22,34,37], increase
in patient uptake of counseling and disease testing
[22,31,50], and improvement on the patient adherence
to treatment [21,22,30-32,37].
Benefits of mHealth projects were described at every
level within the healthcare system, from governments to
clinic staff, and on to patients. Governments may, for in-
stance, benefit from increased support of patient man-
agement [20] and increased direct communication with
stakeholders in rural areas [45,50]. Health workers may
receive support through professional networks, or can
prioritize efforts in areas where they are most needed (e.g.
rural areas uncovered by specific programs or interven-
tions) [37,56], and increase their role in active case
detection using disease surveillance systems [49]. Finally,
patients benefit by saving money from regular consulta-
tions, and can also have increased attention and receive
more support from health providers, as discussed in
previous sections. SMS alone has been proven to help
bridge the communication gap in the health sector be-
tween health workers and patients, different managerial
levels, and between MoH and facilities in the peripheral
areas [17,21,22].
A main reasons given for a highly positive perception
of mHealth projects by health workers, staff and patients
were a high acceptance [16,18,33,34,47,49,56,63] and fa-
miliarity of use of mobile phones [31,34,38,47,59,62].
This is understandable given the large reach that mobile
phones have had in recent years in Africa. The accept-
ance of the technology itself may have an effect in the
overall acceptance of the project. In Botswana and
Uganda for example, the technology was highly ac-
cepted and project outcomes were valued positively
overall [34,35].
Another characteristic of mobile phones is that it may
reduce the feeling of being observed, particularly in situ-
ations that might create stigmas. For instance, results
show tha patient’s perceived value of the use of mHealth
for consultations proved to be more acceptable in sensi-
tive situations where it was more difficult for information
to be discussed in face-to-face consultations e.g. HIV-
infected patients [62]. The use of mobile phones allowed
the patient to keep her privacy.
Other benefits of mHealth are more related to the
technology itself. When compared to other technologies
(e.g PDAs or laptops), mHealth projects benefited from
the fact that mobile phones proved to be less subject to
theft and breakage [17,22,25,28,34,54,63].Although successes have been reported, mHealth inte-
gration into the healthcare system is critical to achieve the
maximum benefits. Projects have proved to be successful
when they have been adapted to the local context and
language [31,62], when the government has an existing
mHealth or eHealth strategy and has an interest or will-
ingness to set-up a system to integrate mHealth projects
[47], and when the project has been developed and imple-
mented by public-private partnerships (e.g. participation
of local private service providers) [25,37] [47]. Regarding
the latter, findings include examples of collaborations be-
tween Universities in developed and developing countries,
research institutes, non-profit organizations, private sec-
tor, public and private hospitals and public sector.
The management of the project is not a simple task
and cannot be minimized. Management remains a core
component of an mHealth project to ensure that out-
comes and goals are achieved. Several factors related to
the management and project design were important
drivers of project success. Examples include providing
adequate incentives (e.g. airtime credit) to ensure a high
response rate to the project [21,22] and providing train-
ing for staff and users [32,52]. These factors cannot be
disregarded by the project manager. Additionally, there
are two important factors that characterize management
of mHealth projects. Firstly, mHealth projects require
minimal human resources and training required is nor-
mally simple [32,54]. Secondly, mHealth requires the
collection of data during the project implementation,
which allows manager to provide real-time supervision
and monitor work rate, attendance and working hours of
the staff involved [47,50].
Despite the positive conclusions of the studies here
presented, it must be noted that the projects are all still
small-scale and success of similar large-scale projects is
not guaranteed. Fortunately, due to the characteristics of
the technology, the estimated low-replication costs and
the high adaptability to local cultural settings [51] in-
creasing the potential of these projects for scaling-up
[32,47,56], particularly if targeting remote and resource-
limited areas [49]. Pilot studies, such as those discussed
here, will allow managers to assess impacts prior to
scaling-up [27].
On a small-scale, findings from this review show that
as accessibility to mobile phones increases, the potential
of mHealth to improve healthcare delivery in Africa is
also increasing remarkably fast; however, there are weak-
nesses and challenges that must be considered and ad-
dressed for mHealth to fulfill this potential.
Weaknesses: what is not working?
One of the major weaknesses of studies on mHealth pro-
jects lies in the fact that the claimed benefits are unclear
and long-term results remain uncertain [16,32,37,46,61,63].
Aranda-Jan et al. BMC Public Health 2014, 14:188 Page 11 of 15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/188Often, studies report that cost-effectiveness is unknown
[29,61], and in some cases studies mention that the evi-
dence is weak, and the external validity and study design
are limited [20,21,27]. The studies report that, while
mHealth projects aim to resolve challenges of data col-
lection, during implementation some problems are still
faced. These include difficulties in monitoring text mes-
sage content [23], data under-reporting [37,46], and the
possibility of receiving biased responses from partici-
pants (e.g. anxiety due to receiving delicate information
on the phone) [14,61].
The participation of the government, via the Ministry of
Health, is a fundamental aspect for success of mHealth pro-
jects. Failure may happen when there is a lack of integration
into the healthcare system and, particularly, when there are
unclear roles and responsibilities at the various different
hierarchical levels (government to managers to health
workers) involved in implementation and operation [45].
For example, mHealth outcomes are highly dependent
on clinical training, practice and experience of health
workers [49,63]. If they are non-existent or provided by
the government actors, the project is unlikely to achieve
its expected goals.
Project design is also an important task for managers
of mHealth projects. In this sense, manager and plan-
ners, in particular, have a strong role to play to ensure
the success of the project. A major condition of the de-
sign is on its adaptability to the local context or tailored
to the population’s needs. Projects have an increased risk
of failure when they have not been designed for or
adapted to the specific context [32].
There are also other important factors related to the
project design that need to be looked at closely. For ex-
ample, planning costs and logistics are essential elements
that, if not assessed accordingly, may affect the delivery
of the intervention (e.g. timely responses or project cover-
age) [14,33,61]. Lack of planning may also affect resources
available for the implementation. For instance, without ad-
equate planning, there could be occasional shortages of
resources, such as staff available, during the project life-
span [22]. This might result in overwhelming staff that
have to deal with an increased workload due to the num-
ber of messages or calls received [50].
Ease-of-use, familiarity with and access to the technol-
ogy were important factors mentioned for implementa-
tion success. However, in some cases it was reported
that, despite the relative ease-of-use, a lack of the skills
required to use the technology was a barrier that limited
staff in responding and acting promptly to text messa-
ging requests [43,62]. To overcome this problem, some
patients asks for support from their relatives or friends,
but this may bring other problem particularly when talk-
ing patient’s data privacy. In terms of use and acceptability
of mobile technology, issues regarding phone ownershipsuch as high phone sharing, lack of money to top-up a
phone and male control over household phone ownership
may also limit results of a project [32,37].
The capacity of mHealth projects is defined by the
capacity of the technology itself. There are for instance,
only a limited number of characters that can be sent
using text message [18], thus limiting the application of
these projects to specific types of interventions. Thus,
the use other technologies to replicate or imitate the same
mHealth project may not result in similar outcomes
[21,25,54]. Other technology-related problems are poor
data quality and transfer [18,37], network loses, phone
maintenance costs [17], risk of theft and loss [19], poor
handling and use [57], a lack of software flexibility and
adaptability, and risk of human errors in the program [63].
In addition to these technical challenges, legal issues
arise in terms of privacy and security measures to be
taken for obtaining, handling and transmitting data. As a
new concept that has gained popularity in recent years
(most of the studies are from 2009 onwards), little was
found mentioned in terms of legal factors, standards and
regulations surrounding the use and application of
mHealth for healthcare services. For instance, privacy con-
cerns exist when a patient is not the direct owner of the
mobile phone [34,56]. In this sense, two possible solutions
were found in the results: firstly, the use of coded informa-
tion for confidentiality protection and data security [63],
and the integration of SMS guidelines into broader clinical
and healthcare processes [50]. Though during project
implementation some measures were taken by researches
(e.g. a security PIN code to protect patient data), these
concepts remain highly unfamiliar and very poorly under-
stood by users [37,54]. Moreover, user expectations in
terms of confidentiality and privacy remain very variable
even within the same population [32].
Threats: why is it not working?
In Africa, mHealth projects may face external barriers
and limitations that might cause project’s failure. Limit-
ing factors need to be considered from early phases of
the project. So far, it was discussed that the project
design and the adaptation to the local context were crit-
ical issues that, if not thoroughly assessed, could result,
worst case scenario, in a complete project failure. These
are factors internal to the project, and can be controlled
by the project manager, researcher or planner.
The limited research and knowledge available on mo-
bile phone applications in health [22], and the scarce
knowledge of the long-term effect of mHealth interven-
tion on health outcomes in low-resource settings [15,62]
are two external factors that may limit potential impacts
of mHealth interventions. There are other factors that
may also threaten project sustainability and delivery of
results. These include the limited funding opportunities

Figure 2 Main considerations for an effective mHealth project
in the African context. Good project design (adapted to the local
context, promotion, education and awareness of the project, etc.),
Technology and resources (use local resources, capacity building,
availability and maintenance), Involvement of stakeholders (strong
public-private partnership, multidisciplinary teams, MoH, political
leadership, local champion) and Government e-health/m-health
department (program monitoring and evaluation, research, etc.).available for long-term implementations [56] and the
dependency of external factors unrelated to the project
itself, such as the duration of patient treatment that
may influence adherence and motivation to participate
[18,63], user’s illiteracy and high workload for facility
staff or health workers [38,54].
Some of the threats for mHealth lie in the health
system and government themselves. The role and level
of involvement of governmental organizations is fun-
damental for project success during its lifespan. How-
ever, for the integration of mHealth into the current
systems, care delivery processes as they stand today
need to be redesigned (e.g. change to electronic re-
cords and data) [22]. Healthcare providers need to de-
velop the cultural and organizational capacity required
to manage digital health information [63]. The lack of
these capacities may lead to late reporting, lack of
feedback and incomplete data collection [63]. Mecha-
nisms to use data collected are also required at the
district and national levels [17,32,43,46,56]. Evidence
shows that there are wide gaps in the understanding of
the complexities that health systems may face in large
scale implementations of mHealth projects [55], or the
standards required for monitoring and evaluating them
[21,34]. A lack of guidance and policies from the Ministry
of Health and inexistent financial support from govern-
ments to deploy mHealth projects are regarded as reasons
for failure [49].
Probably the major limitation for implementation of
mHealth projects is the coverage and accessibility of the
technologies. mHealth is highly dependent on infrastruc-
ture availability in the area where the project is being de-
ployed, hence a reliable network, internet and electricity
access [19,32,34,37,38] are prerequisites. Access to mo-
bile phones in Africa is extensive, but not necessarily re-
liable. Moreover, the technical or expert knowledge for
maintenance and development of platforms (software
and hardware) may be limited or not available locally
[37,56], and when available, the lack of expertise may
slowdown implementation as technical training will nor-
mally be required [49,57,62].
It was previously mention that acceptance was a rea-
son for the success of mHealth project. However, even if
a pilot project may have been perceived as valuable by
the user, there are still questions regarding acceptance of
the technology by the communities as receptiveness is
limited by socioeconomic and sociocultural factors, geo-
graphic barriers and quality of care [19,20,32,33,49]. For
instance, in some places SMS interventions may fail due
to high illiteracy levels and/or user preferences for mak-
ing voice calls or personal appointments [14,17,62]. In
addition to all these factors, little is known in regards of
data protection, and the feasibility and acceptability con-
fidentiality methods [62].Due to all the external factors that may threaten success
of mHealth project, it is important to point out the rele-
vance of the role that management has before, during and
after implementation. The unknown cost-effectiveness of
deployment and maintenance [49,56,63], particularly on a
large-scale [32], and the challenges of management of
mHealth projects remain underestimated [26]. As we gain
more knowledge on mHealth interventions, opportunities
need to be carefully assessed for further implementations.
Opportunities and recommendations
Opportunities to increase implementation and expand ap-
plications of mHealth in Africa are vast, but future steps
need to be taken cautiously. Tomlinson et al. [64] have re-
cently published a review where they discuss the lack of
evidence regarding mHealth effectiveness and efficacy [64].
The authors argue that an mHealth project is likely to
work if there is a follow-up of the project, if it has been de-
signed for specific contexts, and if high consideration has
been given to the frequency of the message delivery, word-
ing and content of the message. While mHealth projects
face challenges and threats, there are also many opportun-
ities. The major opportunity for mHealth is the increasing
mobile phone coverage. As coverage to mobile phone
networks expands and new communication technologies
are developed (e.g. cheaper smartphones), opportunities
for mHealth applications remain high [14-19,22,26,28,
Aranda-Jan et al. BMC Public Health 2014, 14:188 Page 13 of 15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/18831,34,37,40,43,49,56,62]. For instance, innovations for auto-
mated text messaging and partnerships with mobile tech-
nology developers may improve scalability [37,39,49]
However, large-scale or nationwide coverage of mHealth
projects were rarely reported in the literature. While, po-
tential for scaling them up was frequently mentioned
[32,47,56], the lack of secure funds for scaling-up [19,32],
the potentially high set-up costs and unknown cost-
effectiveness [43,63], and the lack of evidence of effective-
ness to assess, for instance, the applicability of mHealth to
other diseases [24,40,44,54,62] are factors that just allow
small scales and limited interventions.
Solutions for the challenges faced by the health sys-
tems in Africa are very much needed. As previously dis-
cussed, opportunities are high where the application of
mHealth can support drug supply and stock manage-
ment [43], stock forecasting [15,47,49], collect and dis-
seminate health data in remote areas [33,58], support
different national disease control programmes and provide
access to data for an evidence-based approach [47,50],
utilize health workforce (e.g. health workers) [19,47,49]
and provide specialized care/mentoring in rural areas
[26,50]. Considering that these projects may be highly at-
tractive and acceptable for private or commercial partners
and governments (MoH) [21,29,49,50], future projects
should consider larger-scales and the full integration into
the healthcare systems.
Recent research into health outcomes of mHealth in-
terventions have been increasing rapidly. According to
the findings of this study, the major threats to mHealth
projects include cultural perception, language, limited
resources in rural settings, weak health systems and
external financing schemes. Whilst factors may be
setting-dependent, Figure 2 provides an overview of the
fundamental elements identified that could lead
mHealth projects to succeed in Africa and integrates the
findings of this study into a tabulated SWOT analysis.
Implications and limitations of the study
A major strength from the present review is that, to the
knowledge of the authors, it is the first time that a sys-
tematic review has been performed to understand and
inform on aspects surrounding mHealth project imple-
mentations in poor settings in general. The results from
this study are consistent with the existing literature, ad-
vocating for mobile phone technologies as useful tools
for health interventions seeking to improve health out-
comes in developing countries [17,21,22,43,60]. Results
show that more evidence-based research is needed in
the field of mHealth implementations, especially for
large-scale and longer-term implementations. Pilot stud-
ies allow to test feasibility at small-scales, and but the
potential of mHealth has not been fully explored–
though frequently mentioned.However, this study presents some limitations. Firstly,
studies included were publications in English, limiting
findings of projects published in French and Spanish. Sec-
ondly, we decided to include only published peer-reviewed
literature. The grey literature contains a vast amount of
rich experiences on mHealth project implementations in
Africa. While we regard them as valuable, through the
present systematic review we have attempted to compile
theory objective according to the evidence available. While
part of our knowledge on the topic has come from reading
grey literature, we consider that a large proportion of them
tend to present positive results only. This is because many
of these projects have been support with funding from
major donors sources, which demand results and effective
outcomes. These demands put pressure on managers who
end up reporting only on the positives, leaving the nega-
tives in the obscurity. Since we aimed to formulate conclu-
sions with a high level of rigor, we decided to narrow our
scope to peer-reviewed literature. We admit that this is
certainly the main limitation of the present study.
Conclusions
The results from this study on mHealth projects in
Africa sought to answer, “what is working with regards to
improving population health? what is not working, and
why?” mHealth implementations pose a potential to be-
come an important part of the health sector to establish-
ing innovative approaches to delivering care and benefits
have been highly praised, but is clear that mHealth pro-
jects are not a solution to the challenges that health sys-
tems face in many African countries. Evidence remains
poor, results are still project- or setting-specific and
questions regarding impact, scalability, increase coverage
(e.g. different diseases, different settings, different target
populations), cost-effectiveness and sustainability of the
projects in Africa are yet to be addressed. While mobile
phone technology continues to improve, more research
on these areas is essential to fully understand the poten-
tial of these projects and help to reach the hard isolated
and marginalized communities in low and middle in-
come countries (LMICs).
