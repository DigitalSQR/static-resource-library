Australia’s International COVID-19 
Vaccination Certificate
using Visible Digital Seal Technology
November 2021
Australian Passport Office presentation

Truly open world travel will require global interoperability of vaccination 
certificates rather than a complex and fragmented system of mutual 
recognition
• This is one of the reasons Australia adopted the Visible Digital Seal (VDS) 
standard specified by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) –
the body responsible for setting standards for international travel 
documents
• Encourage other countries also to apply the ICAO-VDS standard
• And in the short term work to ensure interoperability between current 
formats and the ICAO-VDS standard
• Australia is happy to work with other countries in this endeavour. 
The Australian International COVID-
19 Vaccination Certificate (ICVC)
• The certificate meets the global 
standard specified by the ICAO and 
endorsed by the WHO.
• The certificate uses Visible Digital Seal 
(VDS) technology in the form of a QR 
code that is secure as a passport chip 
and can be digitally authenticated in 
the same way as a passport.
• The QR code can be read at borders 
globally and by travel apps such as the 
IATA TravelPass that many airlines use.
What’s in the certificate? 
• the Australian Government crest
• the title: “International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate”
• a header row containing: 
- the words “Proof of Vaccination” 
- the issuing state (“AUS”) 
- the version number (“1”) 
- a Unique Vaccination Certificate Identifier (UVCI) 
• the VDS QR code, containing all the data elements, 
as well as signature information for authenticating the 
certificate 
• the holder’s name
• date of birth, in the format YYYY-MM-DD 
• gender (‘Sex’), given as “M”, “F” or “X” 
• the holder’s passport number 
• vaccination history, which includes the brand, date, 
batch number, administering centre and country of 
each dose 
- the manufacturer name is included in the vaccine brand name 
- the “Dose number” is in chronological order across 
Vaccination events

Existing passport readers can read and authenticate ICVCs with minor 
software updates. Australia is working with vendors to implement these 
updates. 
For border authorities or others seeking to read ICVCs without passport 
readers the Australian Passport Office has developed a smartphone app.
The VDS-NC Checker app is 
available in the Apple app store 
and Google Play
The app confirms that a VDS is 
genuine and displays the most 
important information from the 
certificate, including the holder’s 
biodata and COVID-19 
immunisations. 
If the QR code is not authentic 
the app displays a message to 
that effect:
About the app
Does the app tell me if a person is fully vaccinated? 
No, it shows the vaccination history. That’s how the VDS standard is meant to 
work. It leaves decisions in the hands of inspecting authorities in the receiving 
state, not the issuing state. 
What about privacy? 
The app has very strong privacy restrictions. It collects no personal 
information – there’s no login or password. And the app doesn’t store or 
transmit any of the information it reads from ICVCs. 
Requesting an ICVC
Requesting an international certificate is easy and free through myGov, the 
Medicare Express Plus app, or by contacting Services Australia. 
As part of Australia’s National Transition Plan, Australia’s international 
border commenced reopening at the start of November. Inbound passenger 
limits were removed for vaccinated Australians and are being progressively 
lifted for non-Australians.
Passengers travelling to Australia provide their International COVID-19 
Vaccination Certificate to prove their status as fully vaccinated.
• Travellers vaccinated overseas who travel to Australia present a foreign-
issued vaccination certificate.
• Most foreign vaccination certificate formats are acceptable.
• Certificates need to be in English or accompanied by a certified translation.
• Travellers have to have received vaccines approved or recognised by 
Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration.
• Paper and digital certificates are equally acceptable
• As are handwritten certificates
• This is possible due to Australia’s high vaccination rate
• Australia is accepting foreign certificates unilaterally, based on criteria that 
are universal, not country-specific
• Truly open world travel will require global interoperability of vaccination 
certificates rather than a fragmented system of mutual recognition
