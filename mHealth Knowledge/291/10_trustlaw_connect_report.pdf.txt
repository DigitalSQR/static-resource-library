SELECTED DEFINITIONS
mHEALTH: Although there is no uniform definition of “mHealth,” the term gener-
ally connotes mobile health as medical and public health practice supported by 
mobile devices, such as mobile phones, patient monitoring devices, personal 
digital assistants (PDAs), and other wireless devices; mHealth involves the use 
and capitalization on a mobile phone’s core utility of voice and short messaging 
service (SMS) as well as more complex functionalities and applications including 
general packet radio service (PRS), third and fourth generation mobile telecom-
munications (3G and 4G systems), global positioning system (GPS), and Blue-
tooth technology
eHEALTH: eHealth covers all uses of network-based information and 
communication technology to promote longer, healthier lives
iNFORMATiONAL PRivACY: an individual’s right to control the acquisition, use, and 
disclosure of identifiable health data
CONFiDENTiALiTY: refers to the obligations of those persons who receive 
mHealth data to preserve secrecy of information entrusted to them and use it 
only as instructed by the patient and/or as necessary to provide the services for 
which the patient entrusted the information to this person.
iNFORMATiON SECURiTY: physical, technological, or administrative safeguards 
or tools used to protect identifiable health data from unwarranted access 
or disclosure, including security of wireless networks, security of devices, 
applications security, back-end systems security, and secure user practices.
GSM vs. CDMA: CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and GSM (Global System 
for Mobiles) are shorthand for the two major radio systems used in mobile 
phones. The United States is a largely a CDMA-based mobile phone market, 
while Europe and the rest of the world have largely embraced GSM. Generally, 
phones built for one system do not work on the other system and vice versa. 
The technology behind each system offers certain default capabilities (such as 
simultaneous voice and data for GSM) and other distinctions that can impact 
interoperability and standardization across mobile networks.
APi: An application programming interface is a protocol intended to be used as 
an interface by software components to communicate with each other.

FOREWORD
Thomson Reuters Foundation is proud to present this TrustLaw report on 
“Patient Privacy in a Mobile World – A Framework to Address Privacy 
Law Issues in Mobile Health“. This work is the result of collaboration with the 
mHealth Alliance, hosted by the United Nations Foundation, international law 
firm Baker & McKenzie and global healthcare provider Merck together with local 
counsel in each of the case study countries.
The Thomson Reuters Foundation leverages the skills, values and expertise of 
Thomson Reuters to run programmes that trigger change and empower people 
across the world: free legal assistance, media development, and in-depth 
coverage of the world’s under-reported stories. The Foundation stands for 
human rights, women’s empowerment, anti-corruption and for the rule of law. 
TrustLaw Connect is the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s global pro bono service 
that amplifies the impact of NGOs and social enterprises by connecting them 
with the best lawyers around the world. Its mission is to spread the practice of 
pro bono worldwide to drive social change.
When the mHealth Alliance first proposed the concept for this project to examine 
the protection of patient privacy in the context of mobile health, we immediately 
recognised it as a wonderful opportunity to bring together some of the best legal 
minds from around the globe to address this pressing issue. A recent United 
Nations study showed that more people now have access to a mobile phone than 
to a toilet, which obviously has huge implications for the growth of mHealth.
It is paramount that privacy concerns are addressed as the field grows, to ensure 
that health information is not used to patients’ detriment, particularly those who 
are vulnerable to discrimination.
We hope that this report will be a useful tool for legislators, policymakers, 
telecommunications companies and healthcare providers to identify the policy 
gaps and the legal and technological changes that need to be addressed in 
order to strengthen privacy laws that relate to mobile healthcare.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Amid the rapid growth of mobile network technology and infrastructure 
throughout the world, especially in low- and middle-income countries, the 
potential of mobile to support the achievement of health priorities is an area 
of active exploration and engagement.  According to a 2011 World Health 
Organization report, governments cite issues related to data privacy and 
security and the protection of individual health information as two of the top 
barriers to the expansion of mHealth. Protecting personal health information 
that is collected and transmitted over mobile devices is essential to bringing 
mHealth to scale and providing a mature foundation for its continued growth.  
The mHealth Alliance, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, Merck, and Baker 
& McKenzie partnered on a project to better understand privacy and security 
policy issues related to mHealth and identify gaps that must be addressed to 
protect health data. The partnership undertook a global landscape analysis of 
current privacy legislation and regulation was undertaken, with a closer look at 
a selected group of case study countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, to 
establish a baseline for the discussion and provide examples of what different 
approaches to privacy regulation are already in use.  The results of this review 
show that the world of privacy law is roughly divided into three major camps: 
(1) omnibus data protection regulation in the style of the European laws that 
regulate all personal information equally; (2) U.S.-style sectoral privacy laws 
that address specific privacy issues arising in certain industries and business 
sectors, so that only certain types of personal information are regulated; and (3) 
the constitutional approach, whereby certain types of personal information are 
considered private and inviolate from a basic human rights perspective but no 
specific privacy regulation is in place otherwise.  
Among the new laws that have been adopted in recent years, the European 
omnibus approach has been the most popular.  This may be attributed at least 
in part to the cross-border transfer restrictions found in the European laws, 
which allow free transfer of personal information across borders only to those 
countries deemed to have “adequate” data protection regulation in place (i.e. 
laws similar to those found in Europe).  To date, the European Commission has 
recognized the adequacy of privacy laws in Andorra, Argentina, Canada, Faeroe 
Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Jersey, the Isle of Man, Switzerland, Uruguay and the 
U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.  However, for the 
rest of the world, this style of law poses an additional barrier to the cross-border 
transfer of personal information, an issue that is especially relevant to mHealth 
and its many transnational aspects.  
 4
Otherwise, this paper summarizes the other major aspects of current laws to 
provide a snapshot of where the laws stand today and a baseline for discussing 
potential reform and the adoption of new laws.  Interestingly, very few of the 
existing laws cover health information specifically (the United States being the 
prime exception) and fewer still make any reference, even in terms of regulatory 
guidance, to mHealth.  The current application of these privacy laws to mHealth 
issues, therefore, is by extension of existing, more general principles related to 
privacy protection.  For this reason and to provide more specific examples that 
can be used to address mHealth privacy issues, this paper also offers an overview 
of medical ethics and patient confidentiality codes in effect throughout the world.
This paper then goes on to set forth a functional framework for addressing 
privacy law issues around the globe, which adapts and is sensitive to particular 
cultural, technological and institutional contexts.  The main pillars of the 
framework are: (1) fact gathering and analysis that aim to identify the key 
drivers for privacy regulation in a particular jurisdiction and the existing 
environment for the development of such laws; (2) determining scope of 
coverage in a thoughtful and deliberate manner that takes into account 
the results of the fact-gathering stage and the potential impact of scoping 
decisions on the further uptake of mHealth in a particular jurisdiction; (3) 
deciding the nature of any notice and consent requirements built into the 
privacy law  reflecting the cultural and technological context of the jurisdiction 
where the law would be implemented; (4) incorporating the principle of data 
minimization into any law as a best practice; (5) encouraging the right of data 
integrity and accessibility for data subjects while requiring such requests to be 
commercially reasonable and feasible for the entities storing data to honor; (6) 
requiring the adoption of reasonable data security measures while remaining 
nimble and open to new technological advances in this area; (7) ensuring that 
data is protected throughout its lifecycle through cross-border and third-
party transfer restrictions, while being sensitive to the operational burdens 
such restrictions could place on market participants and the consequences 
for the uptake of mHealth; (8) determining the enforcement and sanctions 
mechanisms built into the law to credibly encourage compliance, which also 
requires an honest assessment of the jurisdiction’s enforcement resources.
The hope is that the work undertaken here can provide a working taxonomy 
and toolbox for those who continue to explore and develop these issues in the 
coming months and years.  It is worth noting that this paper does not set out to 
prescribe legal solutions to specific data privacy problems or advocate for one 
universal model law for the entire world.  The authors believe that a one-size-
fits-all approach is simply not appropriate in the privacy context and much less 
in an environment, such as mHealth, where the technology and the issues are 
still evolving every day.
INTRODUCTION
Today the ubiquity of mobile phone technology is 
undeniable. The World Bank reported that the number of 
mobile subscriptions in use worldwide, both pre-paid and 
post-paid, has grown from fewer than 1 billion in 2000 to 
over 6 billion in 2012 (current world population estimates 
are near 7 billion).1 Other reports show that mobile 
penetration rates in Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America 
are expected to reach 82%, 98% and 120% respectively in 
2014.2 In fact, some developing countries such as Algeria, 
Botswana, Brazil, Chile, Indonesia and Malaysia have 
already crossed the 100% mobile penetration mark.3 Cisco 
reports worldwide 48 million people without electricity 
and landline Internet access have a mobile phone, showing 
that mobile use outpaces basic infrastructure in many rural 
and developing areas.4 Mobile telephony’s reach in the 
developing world is presenting innovative and promising 
solutions, such as with the mobile-based money transfer 
system in Kenya, M-Pesa, and, more broadly, mobile health 
technology, the subject of this paper.
The use of mobile and wireless technologies to support 
the achievement of health objectives (“mHealth”) has been

reported offering at least one type of mHealth service, with 
many countries offering four to six programs. Amongst the 
most frequently reported mHealth initiatives were: health 
call centers (59%), emergency toll-free telephone services 
(55%), managing emergencies and disasters (54%), and 
mobile telemedicine (49%).6 At the United Nations Summit 
on the Millennium Development Goals in September 
2010, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched a global 
strategy to improve women and children’s health that 
relied heavily on the use of mobile devices.
Donors including national aid agencies, international 
institutions, and philanthropic foundations in both the 
developing and developed worlds have provided tens 
of millions of dollars for mHealth and electronic health 
(eHealth) initiatives.7 According to a report by the World 
Bank, such commitments appear to be increasing, 
including a $200 million commitment from Johnson & 
Johnson for a five-year program targeting expectant 
and new mothers in developing countries, a significant 
portion of which will be focused on a program called 
Mobile Health for Mothers.8 Developed country funding 
has also grown significantly, with an estimated $233

States.9 Indeed, after $86 million was raised in an initial 
public offering by Epocrates—the most popular medical 
application used by U.S. healthcare professionals—it was 
said that mobile applications for healthcare may be the 
next big trend for venture capital investments.10
With the potential that it holds, mHealth has received 
significant attention in recent years with specific initiatives 
deployed to study factors that could improve its uptake 
and effectiveness. One of the areas identified as 
essential to the broader uptake of mHealth is the need to 
strengthen mHealth privacy and security and the public’s 
perception of the same – particularly in low- and middle-
income countries – the theory being that greater trust 
in mHealth’s privacy and security will encourage more 
people to use mHealth and benefit from its advantages. 
However, as will be shown throughout this paper, data 
privacy and security are affected by a myriad of factors. 
They are best understood as part of a diverse ecosystem 
that can strengthen or weaken them in complex ways. Law 
is only one of those factors but an important one. Law is 
often seen as a method of effecting behavioral change, 
creating minimum standards of quality and care, and 
encouraging broad adoption of recognized best practices. 
For this reason, the law and regulation of mHealth 
privacy and security is of special interest to the mHealth 
community. It is viewed as an essential pillar in building a 
mature mHealth marketplace. To that end, while remaining

mindful of the law’s place in the broader mHealth 
ecosystem, this paper will provide an overview of the state 
of mHealth privacy and security laws today, with a closer 
look at a select group of jurisdictions in Africa, Asia and 
Latin America, and lay out a framework for further analysis 
of mHealth privacy and security law issues as mHealth 
continues to grow and mature.
OBJECTivE
This paper aims to develop a functional framework for addressing privacy 
law issues in the mHealth arena worldwide. The framework can be applied to 
analyze existing privacy law systems and proposals for new privacy laws and 
regulation. It also lays the groundwork for additional research and analysis of 
the privacy law issues affecting the uptake of mHealth. The framework reflects 
and takes into account the international legal and regulatory landscape, cultural 
conventions, and technological functionalities relating to data security, while 
maintaining the integrity of patient autonomy as to privacy and confidentiality 
and the utility of reliable and expedient access to accurate and comprehensive 
healthcare data by various stakeholders.
BACKGROUND
Dozens of papers and studies have been published in recent years regarding 
the growth and potential of mHealth. These reports recognize that mHealth 
continues to be in its nascent state and are keen to point out areas for concerted 
effort to help mHealth grow in a healthy, robust manner. One of the themes that 
has emerged from such work is the need to better address the data privacy and 
security concerns surrounding the use of mHealth. 
The WHO, for example, has observed that “Data security is a particularly 
important issue to address within the area of policy.... Policy-makers and 
programme managers need to be made aware of security issues in the 
mHealth domain so appropriate policies and strategies can be developed and 
implemented.”11 The Earth Institute has stated that within the various mHealth 
policies being discussed, “issues such as data security, access control, and

thus confidentiality must be addressed (as they have been for mFinance).12 
“Questions surrounding the rights to health information should be addressed 
under this policy framework, in addition to issues regarding information usage.”13 
The Association for Computing Machinery published a paper on mHealth 
privacy from the technologist’s perspective that specifically cites the need for 
policymakers to “establish laws, regulations, and standards regarding the 
protection of patient privacy in mHealth technology.”14
Although the need for greater transparency and predictability as to mHealth 
privacy appears to be broadly recognized and, within that need, a role for 
policymakers and the law, defining what privacy, security and confidentiality mean 
in different parts of the world is a challenge. Consequently defining a legal system 
to address mHealth privacy and security issues in a global sense is challenging. 
These concepts are influenced by a multitude of factors, including law, technology 
and custom, among others, that vary widely around the globe.

Custom and Various Other Factors

As such, any privacy law system likely will need to be uniquely adapted to 
its local environment (its culture, infrastructure, institutions, sophistication, 
complexity, resources, etc.) despite the inherently global nature of mHealth 
services and products.

CLUSTER SCENARIOS AND RELATED ISSUES
NATURE OF PROTECTED DATA Personal information versus aggregated data; exceptions for law 
enforcement; public health monitoring; corroboration of end-of-life 
determinations and surrogate/proxy designations; health research; 
analysis of health needs for funding decisions; anonymous data could be

NORMATivE CULTURAL Disparate concepts of privacy, confidentiality, and security, including 
DiSPARiTiES across urban and rural areas
That being said it will be useful for purposes of this paper to think of mHealth 
privacy in a broad sense as the ability of all patients to exercise control over the 
collection, recording, access and dissemination of their mHealth data,16 such 
that preserving that ability (in all its subtle variations) should be a priority for 
those seeking to bring mHealth to scale. mHealth data security can be viewed 
as a subset of this basic principle and as a necessary ingredient to ensuring 
that patients can maintain the privacy they seek. Without appropriate physical, 
technological and administrative security safeguards, all the privacy promises in 
the world hold limited value. Confidentiality is a related principle and refers to the 
obligations of those persons who receive mHealth data to preserve its secrecy 
and use it only as instructed by the patient and/or as necessary to provide the 
15 Scenarios developed in cooperation with the mHealth Alliance.
16 Adapted from the definition of “health informational privacy” used by the National Committee of Vital and 
Health Statistics, a committee within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

services for which the patient entrusted the information to this person. Think of it 
as the oldest and most low-tech method of ensuring patient privacy.
CONFiDENTiALiTY vS. PRivACY
Think of “confidentiality” as the oldest and most low-tech method  
of ensuring patient privacy.
With those general concepts in mind, we will now review in more detail some 
of the major factors affecting mHealth privacy and security, with some specific 
examples, to better understand the context for the development of any legal 
reform in this area.
TECHNOLOGY’S EFFECTS ON MHEALTH PRIVACY AND SECURITY
Technology’s expansion is mHealth’s prime enabler and precisely what makes 
it suitable for leveraging in even the most remote areas of the globe. But, with 
all the promise and potential of technology also come various challenges. 
First and foremost, its ever-evolving nature makes it difficult (and some may 
say ill-advised) to create rigid legal rules that may not fit future mHealth 
applications or, worse, that may hamper their development in the first place. 
Other challenges posed by technology include: absence of cross-border 
interoperable functionality or standards (e.g., GSM versus CDMA); variety of 
devices and mHealth technologies (e.g., digital imaging, robotics, micro- and 
nanotechnologies, genomics); and risks of use (e.g., loss, theft, unauthorized 
access, malware, cloning, phishing, sharing of devices, lack of understanding 
about residual availability of data after purported deletions when recycling or 
discarding, network congestion, etc.).
Technology is also in many ways the first line of defense in terms of providing 
security to the data that is meant to be kept private. The law may prescribe 
“reasonable security standards” or require that any such standards are extended 
by contract to all parties in the data supply chain but the law can seldom set 
forth with much success the particular technological tools to be applied to 
fulfill a given legal obligation. In terms of data security especially, the threat is 
constantly evolving and out-pacing current security standards. A nimble, agile 
response is required, which detailed regulation can sometimes hamper. Also 
national detailed data security legislation could create conflicts among laws 
of different countries where an mHealth application is going to be launched. 
Developers already struggle with interoperability across borders. Some of the 
hardest security challenges are the ones that developers face when trying to 
 12 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
deploy their applications on all the networks around the world.17 Adding a layer 
of conflicting security regulations to the mix will not help matters. 
It is also important to understand that mobile security is itself a layered issue. 
There is security at the level of the application, the mobile operating software, 
the hardware device, the wireless network and the wireless carrier, not to 
mention the servers that transmit, process and store the data and the security 
practices of the mobile phone users themselves (e.g., setting strong passwords, 
storing the phone securely). Deciding where to place the obligation to maintain 
adequate security is a complex question.  There are security options available at 
each of the layers shown below, including secure networks for transmission of 
data at the server and network level, encryption and password-protection at the 
device level, firewalls and access controls at the operating software level and 
secure transmission and limited access to other functions of the mobile device at 
the application level.18

CULTURE’S EFFECT ON mHEALTH PRIVACY AND SECURITY
Culture is perhaps the most complex of the major factors affecting mHealth 
privacy and security. The law, in general, is culturally-specific. Crimes, for 
example, are defined in vastly different ways across the globe (e.g., in some 
places jaywalking is a crime, in others adultery by women only is prosecuted 
criminally). Privacy is particularly culturally sensitive and subjective, so that any 
legal reform in this area should be adapted to the cultural context in which the 
laws are to be implemented.

For example, individual consent is possibly a luxury that is not afforded to 
individuals in some environments where access may be limited, or even provided 
through another individual (e.g., in some contexts, women may not access 
healthcare when it is provided by men, so husbands and fathers will go to the 
health clinics on behalf of women19). Consent in the privacy context, thus, would 
have to take into account what legal and practical capacity to consent exists for the 
individuals concerned. This is a nearly-universal issue when it comes to consent 
by children and, in some places, can also be an issue for women or marginalized 
populations. In Indonesia, for example, there are practices of mandatory pregnancy 
tests, virginity tests, and a number of laws and practices that deny Indonesian 
women who become pregnant outside marriage full access to maternal care and 
reproductive health.20 These practices could also have repercussions in terms of 
who is deemed to have access to the results of such tests. 
In a more practical sense, the developed world model of personal ownership 
of a phone may not be appropriate as the sole model in the developing world 
where shared mobile telephone use could be common (although perhaps 
decreasingly so).21 The mHealth community should be sensitive to the use of 
shared mobile phones and the effect such practices have on the concept of 
privacy and individual consent. Of course, for some types of health information, 
such as a preloaded generic first aid information kit, there would be less 
concern, while for others more sensitive and personal information, especially 
personal medical records and targeted SMS messaging for conditions that 
may be stigmatized such as HIV/AIDS, shared mobile phones could pose a real 
challenge to the preservation of patient privacy and confidentiality.22 
LAW’S EFFECT ON mHEALTH PRIVACY AND SECURITY
In countries where privacy (also known as data protection) laws have been 
enacted and then vigorously enforced, there is generally broader awareness of 
privacy rights and greater consistency in the level of privacy disclosures made 
to individuals before they are asked to provide personal information. Failure 
to provide these disclosures and/or abide by the privacy promises made in 
these disclosures can lead to quite severe administrative fines and penalties 
and, in some places, even civil causes of action with both compensatory and 
punitive damages. As will be set forth in greater detail below, even among

these countries with actively enforced privacy laws, they take vastly different 
approaches to regulating privacy. These different approaches lead to different 
methods (and related costs) of compliance but it is more difficult to ascertain the 
differing results in terms of achieving the goal of giving individuals the ability 
to exercise control over the collection, recording, access and dissemination 
of their personal information. It is also difficult (although less so) to assess 
the true compliance cost of certain approaches, both in terms of actual costs 
of compliance (implementation, legal advice, required changes to process 
or business model) and the more abstract costs to innovation and diverse 
investment in the regulated sector. For this reason, rather than advocating for 
the adoption of a particular approach, this paper aims to provide an overview of 
the different approaches and bring these laws down to their elements so that a 
functional privacy law framework can be developed. 
In addressing the effect of law on mHealth privacy and security, one must also 
be conscious of the effect of non-privacy laws. For example, many countries are 
now mandating national SIM card registries, so that every mobile phone can be 
linked back to an individual citizen.23 In such countries, any definition of personal 
information may need to take into account that at least certain government 
agencies would be able to de-anonymize information transmitted over mobile 
phones and, thus, turn it into personal information. Protections could also be 
put in place to limit the government’s ability to share this information across 
agencies or use it for law enforcement purposes. 
GENDER-BASED PRivACY CONCERNS
There are countries where adultery is a criminal offense for women, so 
that innocent or inadvertent release of such information to third parties 
(including family members) could lead to severe punishment of the patient.
In another type of example, the laws that apply to women in some countries 
can make a mobile-enabled diagnosis into a very serious legal offense. For 
instance, the diagnosis of a recessive genetic disorder can also inadvertently 
reveal non-paternity if the father and child are both tested (a recessive disorder 
requires the disease causing mutation to be present in both parents and for the 
child to inherit both copies).24 There are countries where adultery is a criminal 
23 For example, SIM card registration in Uganda is part of the East Africa Communications Organisation 
(EACO) initiative, which set mid 2012 as the deadline to have all existing SIM cards in East Africa registered.

offense for women, so that innocent or inadvertent release of such information 
to third parties (including family members) could lead to severe punishment of 
the patient. In such countries, where disclosure of certain types of mHealth data 
could lead to severe consequences under seemingly unrelated laws, perhaps 
the punishment for even inadvertent disclosures (absent of bad faith) contrary 
to patient instructions or the promises made by the mHealth provider should 
be especially severe to effectively deter such conduct and encourage sufficient 
safeguards to prevent these unintended repercussions. A corollary revision to 
the laws of evidence to exclude the admissibility of such personal information to 
prove adultery could also be introduced but this type of provision would be less 
likely to be enacted where the laws are particularly aggressive in the prosecution 
of these types of offenses against women. 
OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING mHEALTH PRIVACY AND SECURITY
Technology, culture and the law are only a few of the most visible factors 
affecting mHealth privacy and security. Countless other less obvious factors 
interact with both the conception of privacy and security and the ability to effect 
any change in these areas. Any reform to privacy and security law should take 
special care to identify all such factors, especially those with greater impact 
where an exhaustive list is not pragmatic, and assess them as a system with 
multi-lateral cause and effect scenarios that can have repercussions many layers 
away in the mHealth ecosystem.
A recent study from the London School of Economics pointed out that this issue 
is even more acute in resource-constrained environments, such as low-income 
countries and disaster-relief situations (where mHealth could be leveraged to 
even greater effect):
“Neither the patients nor the practitioners are particularly aware of rights 
and responsibilities. Literacy may be minimal, so notices are insufficient. 
Populations may be more mobile and therefore patient registration may 
be even more important and yet difficult to achieve. Care providers may 
be responsible for larger numbers of patients. Staff may not be trained 
in procedures. The technical infrastructure may vary, with problems with 
electricity, so running additional processes and procedures may prove too 
challenging. Multiple organizations may be operating in the same space, 
with implementing partners and government agencies, whereby it may 
be difficult to identify the primary custodians of the information. All of 
these barriers are exacerbated in humanitarian operations.”25

 16 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
In such situations, flexibility and adaptability of privacy regulation or the 
adoption of certain safe harbors may be particularly important as rigid rules may 
cause users to abandon mHealth altogether for inability or impracticability of 
complying weighed against the high need for the medical services being sought. 
Indeed, the same data security regulations employed in the United States with 
some success may be of no use to a low-income country with fewer enforcement 
capabilities and less-developed infrastructure. Any solution must be adapted to 
its unique environment.

“Neither the patients nor the practitioners are particularly aware of 
rights and responsibilities. Literacy may be minimal, so notices are 
insufficient. Populations may be more mobile and therefore patient 
registration may be even more important and yet difficult to achieve.”
In addition, it is important to consider what industry efforts are being made to 
increase the privacy and security of mHealth. Such initiatives could address a 
number of key concerns in an effective and flexible manner and any legal reform 
should take stock of these initiatives to both learn from them and to ensure that 
any new laws or regulations do not negatively impact any positive aspects of 
such programs. For example, in January 2011, the GSM Association published 
a set of universal Mobile Privacy Principles that describe the way in which 
mobile consumers’ privacy should be respected and protected when consumers 
use mobile applications and services that access, collect and use personal 
information.26 In collaboration with representatives from the mobile ecosystem, 
the GSM Association has also developed a discussion document outlining a 
set of Privacy Design Guidelines for Mobile Application Development. These 
documents are geared toward the privacy of personal information generally, not 
mHealth specifically, but are indicative of the type of industry efforts aimed at 
addressing privacy from the earliest stages of design and development. 
USES OF MHEALTH AND THE “mHEALTH ECOSYSTEM”
Crucial to developing an adequate mHealth privacy and security framework 
(while acknowledging the roles of technology, law, custom and other factors)  
is understanding how mHealth data flows and is used (and by whom). Any 
privacy solution must make sense given mHealth’s current and potential  
uses and applications.

mHealth Uses
A recent study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and funded by the 
GSM Association estimates that the worldwide mHealth market will grow to 
approximately $23 billion by 2017.27 This market contains applications ranging 
from wellness and diet to diagnosis and treatment. Europe leads the way, with 
the United States close behind and then Asia, Latin America and Africa. Although 
Africa still lags behind its neighbors in mHealth adoption, news reports show 
that, where used, mHealth is being successfully deployed in several African 
countries.28 Tanzania, for example, uses mobile stock management technology 
to track malaria treatments in 5,000 clinics across the country.29 In South Africa, 
1,800 remote community health workers use mobile phones to access and 
update patient records. And when Ghana rolled out rotavirus and pneumococcal 
vaccines this April, a major local religious organization helped notify mothers 
about the new immunizations by arranging for 1.5 million SMS messages to 
be sent out.30 South Sudan, supported by the WHO, began to manage vaccine 
stocks through mobile technology in mid-2012 in its central and state stores, 
while Rwanda’s health ministry uses mobile phones to monitor maternal and 
child mortality.31 Other uses for mHealth include: 
— Enumeration of clients and service equity (patient registration & vital events 
tracking)
— Continuity of care (electronic health records)
— Accountability for health services (scheduling & reminders)
— Increased safety and quality of care (decision support for providers)
— Knowledge and access to information (education & behavior change 
communication)
— Skilled health workforce (providing training and service updates)
— Access to commodities & health staff (commodity & human resources 
management)
— Reduce financial & motivational barriers (health financing & incentives)
— Connected health system (communication & telemedicine)
— Up-to-date national health information (real-time indicator reporting)32

These different uses will trigger subtle differences in how patients seek control 
over the collection, recording, access and dissemination of their mHealth 
data. For example, in a text messaging campaign to increase adherence to 
antiretroviral treatment, patients noted that it was important to them that 
the messages maintained confidentiality and privacy by using coded words or 
phrases (“Remember, it is the time of your life”) instead of “sensitive” words 
(HIV or antiretroviral), suggesting that patients want health-related SMSs 
that appropriately notify them, deliver a carefully crafted message, and are 
sensitive to the context in which they are received.33 These are relatively common 
sense (though not self-evident) methods for ensuring privacy of mHealth data 
that legal regulation would have little ability to prescribe. A combination of 
user-centric design by mHealth providers and developers must factor into the 
contemplated privacy solutions to ensure greater effectiveness. This example 
shows that law alone cannot always identify the best practice in a given situation 
that is sufficiently well-suited to the particular patient. 
By the same token, the level of security mechanisms that would be appropriate 
to protect a phone with an attached monitoring device that stores mHealth 
data locally and remits it to a health care provider remotely should be as 
sophisticated as the device itself. Mandating this same level of security, likely 
including encryption and other high-technology solutions, on the HIV treatment 
text-messaging campaign described above would not be effective and would do 
nothing to protect the privacy of the information transmitted across the device 
if it still spoke in plain terms about the HIV treatment instead of using coded 
language. In sum, there is no one-size-fits-all solution.
mHealth Stakeholders
We have already mentioned the importance of patients and ensuring patients’ 
autonomy as to how their mHealth data is handled, but there are other 
participants in the mHealth ecosystem to consider as well, all of whom may 
contribute to a patient’s mHealth data record, maintain it, access it or use  
it in varying ways that should inform the development of any new privacy  
laws and regulations. As this system matures, more and more of these 
information transfers may occur between information exchanges to which all the 
participants may have access.

METHODOLOGY
Based on the background set forth above and the resulting sketch of the 
“mHealth ecosystem”, this paper analyzes current research on mHealth privacy 
issues and provides a broad overview of the current global landscape of national 
policies, laws and regulations that target privacy and security issues as they 
relate to mHealth. The resources relied upon for this part of the paper include 
original laws, academic commentary, judicial interpretation and regulatory 
guidance from selected representative countries from North America, Europe, 
Africa, Latin America and Asia. The result of this research is a global mHealth 
privacy law landscape, highlighting regional variances in approach to privacy 
law in an attempt to showcase the options available as the mHealth community 
continues to grapple with how best to strengthen mHealth privacy and security 
through the law.
The second section of the paper takes a closer look at the state of privacy law 
and any particular legislation and policy in the mHealth space in a select group 
of jurisdictions by conducting a high level gap analysis in consultation with local 
privacy attorneys in Tanzania, Uganda, Nigeria, Bangladesh, India, Peru and Chile, 
jurisdictions that have begun to experience promising mobile health programs. 
The results of this analysis are summarized and identifiable trends are highlighted.
 20 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
Finally, informed by the above analyses and research, this paper sets out to 
create a functional privacy law framework that can be applied to different 
scenarios and environments to produce a thoughtful discussion and drive 
toward the over-arching guiding principle of providing patients control and 
autonomy over their mHealth data while preserving the efficacy of mHealth 
solutions and applications.
Please note that this paper is not intended to provide a comprehensive digest 
of all applicable laws of any jurisdiction surveyed or reviewed, nor does it 
encompass review of or recommendations about technological functionalities 
relating to data storage, processing, or transmission. 
GLOBAL LANDSCAPE OF 
CURRENT mHEALTH PRIVACY 
AND SECURITY LAWS AND 
PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY
LAWS
This section provides a high-level summary of the most pertinent laws from 
a number of representative jurisdictions across the globe, followed by a 
description of the main elements of each law (e.g., covered entities, covered 
data, disclosure obligations, penalties, etc.). The aim is to provide the mHealth 
community with an inventory of the health privacy laws on the books, so 
that different approaches can be analyzed and new approaches may be 
contemplated. Although organizations such as the WHO have conducted global 
surveys of laws directly related to eHealth,34 these reports do not go into detail 
with respect to specific legal provisions contained in the existing laws that do or 
might impact eHealth and/or mHealth. 
Also, unlike the WHO surveys, this overview does not take a position as to 
whether one legal approach is superior to another or whether any existing laws 
are insufficient to address the new challenges posed by eHealth and mHealth. 
This section merely aims to provide a compilation of current representative 
laws for further study and analysis by the mHealth community according to the 
framework developed in this paper.
The laws and approaches discussed in this section differ significantly, but we 
have broken down each law into the following core elements to aid comparison 
and the learning process:
— Coverage
» Persons/entities obligated to comply
» Personal information covered
» Scope of coverage
— Information/Notification requirements
» Consent requirements

— Data security obligations
» Retention/Destruction
» Technical and organizational security (including cloud storage)
» Breach notification obligations
— Data transfer (including cross-border) requirements
— Enforcement and sanctions
None of the laws reviewed and none known to the authors to date explicitly 
address mHealth. However, some laws regulate health privacy (and some even 
expressly address electronic health privacy) specifically and do so sufficiently 
broadly so as to arguably reach mHealth applications if such applications were 
to handle covered data (i.e., remote diagnostic services would likely be covered 
while general health information applications would not due to the scope of 
many applicable laws). Others have no specific health privacy regulations but 
cover all types of personal information equally, so that mHealth applications 
that handle covered data (relating to an identifiable person) would also be 
subject to these laws. 
Some countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa without comprehensive 
privacy laws or specific health privacy laws do have constitutional protections 
and/or medical ethics codes to provide some level of protection. However, these 
countries are facing a choice as to whether to implement new laws (as Mexico 
and Singapore have recently done) and, if so, whether to adopt a sectoral 
approach (with laws specific to certain industries or sectors, such as in the 
United States) or an omnibus approach (with one national law covering all types 
of personal information and imposing a minimum level of regulation across 
all types of data). Then, they must decide where to draw the line on scope of 
coverage, level of regulatory detail, and enforcement mechanisms. For these 
countries, this section can provide a roadmap for different types of options.
Countries with existing laws face the constant question of whether to continue 
to legislate and for what purpose. For these countries, this section can provide a 
general sense as to what other countries are doing and what level of regulatory 
rigor they are applying. We begin our review with the United States, which 
has one of the most-detailed health and eHealth privacy statutes currently on 
the books. We then review the competing European omnibus approach and 
examples of legislation currently in force in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.  As 
noted above, however, we have not included in this section an assessment as to 
which approach is better in part because we believe the answer will depend on 
the local context and capabilities.

— No overarching privacy law
— Emphasizes that mobile app developers should provide clear,

Introduction to Applicable Laws
The United States, unlike many other countries, does not have an overarching 
data privacy law that applies to all types of personal information, including 
health information. However, it does have a general health privacy law with 
broad application that may be extended to mHealth to the extent the data 
concerned fits the legal definition of covered data (denoted as “protected health 
information” in this particular law) and the entities involved in the processing 
of data qualify as a “covered entity” (or a business associate/service provider 
of such covered entity). In addition, there is a patchwork of federal and state 
laws that regulates particular kinds of data and industry sectors, which may be 
extended to mHealth as well. 
Federal Laws
HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT  
OF 1996 (“HIPAA”)
One of the most important federal laws governing confidential health 
information in the United States is the federal Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”).35 
Pursuant to HIPAA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
(“HHS”) has issued regulations governing the privacy of health information that 
is maintained in electronic form, notably the “Privacy Rule” and the “Security 
35 Pub. L. No. 104-191, as implemented by 45 C.F.R. § 160, 162, 164.
 24 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
Rule.”  The Privacy Rule requires that certain entities, including health plans and 
healthcare providers who transmit health information, ensure the confidentiality 
of certain health-related information. These entities cannot disclose health 
information except for purposes of treatment, payment for treatment, and 
health care operations without obtaining authorization from the patient or 
participant. The Privacy Rule also affords patients and participants certain rights 
with respect to their data, such as the right to access and suggest changes to 
records of their health information and to be informed of certain disclosures of 
their health information to others. The covered entity must also comply with 
certain administrative requirements, such as providing notices to patients and 
participants about how the entity handles their health information. 
The Security Rule provides certain technical and organizational requirements so 
that covered entities “[e]nsure the confidentiality, integrity and availability”36 of 
health information. The Security Rule outlines various obligations to ensure this 
goal, including appointing and training certain employees regarding security, 
establishing certain plans to identify and respond to risks such as interference 
with system operations and unauthorized access, use, disclosure or modification 
or data, and establishing procedures to ensure that only authorized individuals 
have access to health information.
In addition, the “Business Associate” rules require that covered entities enter 
into agreements with other entities that perform functions for the covered 
entity where the third party may have access to health information. Pursuant to 
the HITECH Act (as further described below), these third parties, or “business 
associates” may be subject to direct government enforcement and may incur 
penalties for violating HIPAA rules.
In 2009, another law was passed (the “HITECH Act”) that revised the Privacy 
Rule and the Security Rule. The final omnibus rule pursuant to these revisions 
was published by HHS on January 25, 2013.37 In particular, the new omnibus 
rule expands the entities covered by HIPAA to include Health Information 
Organizations, entities that provide data transmission services for health 
information, and personal health record vendors.
These obligations may require mobile health technology providers to enter into 
business associate agreements with their own subcontractors that impose the 
same HIPAA compliance requirements on the subcontractor that apply to the 
business associate. The new rule also relaxes some limitations on the use of 
health information for the purpose of fundraising. In addition, the rules prohibit 
selling health information without authorization, but disclosure for research 
purposes and certain other purposes are permitted, and it is acceptable to receive 
a reasonable fee for the cost of preparing and transmitting the health information.

CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 1998 (“COPPA”)
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 199838, as implemented by the 
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule39 (the “Rule”) (collectively “COPPA”) 
prohibits the collection of personal information from children under the age of 
13 through commercial websites or online services without obtaining express 
consent from a parent or legal guardian. This law could apply in the mHealth 
context to the extent applications collect personal information directly from 
children. This law also provides an example of how legislators have addressed 
the difficult task of developing effective authentication procedures (to confirm 
parental consent), which could be instructive to the mHealth community. 
COPPA, as recently amended, may require mobile health technology providers 
that collect health information from children, such as through pediatric care 
applications, to establish procedures for obtaining express parental consent for 
the collection and processing of that information. Such providers would also need 
to ensure that they provide the proper notices through their mobile applications 
and maintain reasonable security procedures to protect the data collected. If such 
mobile healthcare providers use third parties to process personal information 
collected from children, the providers would also need to require that the third 
parties maintain security measures to protect the information.
FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION ACT (“FTC ACT”)
Under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”)40, the 
Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has broad authority to take action against 
individuals and/or entities that engage in what the FTC Act terms “unfair or 
deceptive” practices. Pursuant to this authority, the FTC has taken action 
against organizations that violate their consumer privacy policies (considered a 
“deceptive” practice) and, more recently, against organizations that engage in 
practices that the FTC has deemed to be contrary to consumer protections or 
otherwise harmful to consumers, even where those practices are disclosed in 
consumer privacy policies (considered “unfair” practices).
While the FTC Act itself does not set forth express requirements regarding data 
protection, the FTC has published specific guidance regarding its approach to 
data protection enforcement under the FTC Act, including the Framework and 
the Report (the “Guidance”). 
In February 2013, the FTC issued guidance specifically for mobile applications 
in a report titled “Mobile Privacy Disclosures: Building Trust Through 
Transparency.” (the “Report”). In the Report, the FTC specifies four primary 
38 15 U.S.C. § 6501 et. seq.
39 16 C.F.R. § 312.1 et. seq.
40 15 U.S.C. § 45.
 26 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
recommendations that mobile app platforms, or interfaces through which 
consumers access mobile applications, should adopt: (1) consistent disclosures; 
(2) oversight across apps; (3) transparency regarding mobile app review; and (4) 
a Do Not Track mechanism for behavioral advertising. For mobile application 
developers, the Report provides that they should (1) establish and publish a 
privacy policy for their apps that is available through the platform; and (2) 
provide just-in-time disclosures and obtain user consent for the collection of 
“sensitive content” beyond a platform’s  application programming interface 
(“API”) (but not to overlap with disclosures issued by the platform), among other 
requirements. Overall, the Report stresses the need for mobile application 
platforms and developers to provide clear, readily-identifiable, and easy to 
understand methods to notify a user when certain kinds of data are being 
collected and/or transmitted. 
State Laws
STATE BREACH NOTIFICATION LAWS, INFORMATION SECURITY 
REQUIREMENTS AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION RESTRICTIONS
Many individual U.S. states have enacted their own information security and 
breach notification laws that require organizations to implement security 
measures to protect certain types of personal data and provide notice in the 
event of a data security breach affecting certain types of personal data. 
As of January 2013, forty-six states, the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico, and 
the Virgin Islands have all enacted some form of a breach notification law41. 
These laws generally require an individual or an entity that “owns or maintains” 
certain types of personal information about a state resident to notify that 
resident and possibly state agencies, credit reporting agencies, and the media 
in the event of a data security breach. The laws typically set forth requirements 
around the timing, format, and content of the notice, which vary by state.
In addition, an increasing number of U.S. states have enacted information 
security laws that require covered individuals or legal entities that process 
certain types of personal information to implement information security 
measures to protect the security and integrity of that information. The specific 
elements of the required security measures typically vary by state. In general, 
however, state information security laws require covered entities to implement 
“reasonable” security measures, appropriate to the type of personal information. 
The Massachusetts information security law, however, differs from most 
other such state laws. Instead of setting forth a reasonableness standard, the 
Massachusetts law requires covered individuals and entities to implement 
specific administrative, physical, and technical safeguards on a comprehensive 
41 As of January 2013, Alabama, Kentucky, New Mexico, and South Dakota have not enacted breach notification 
laws.
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 27
level. Massachusetts has adopted specific regulations that set forth the 
elements of those safeguards (the “Regulations”).
As applied to mobile health technology providers, state breach notification laws 
would require such providers to issue notice to affected individual residents 
of a state with such a law if the provider holds personal information about 
state residents that is covered under and accessed in a manner that triggers 
the relevant law.  A limited number of U.S. states (e.g., Arkansas, California, 
Missouri, Texas, and Virginia) include health and/or medical data within the 
types of data covered by security breach notification laws.  In those states and 
well as under HIPAA (for covered entities and business associates) unauthorized 
loss and/or access to health and medical information would likely trigger breach 
notification requirements. Additionally, mobile health technology providers 
would generally be required to implement reasonable security measures to 
protect individual health and medical data. Where the provider holds covered 
data about Massachusetts residents, the provider will likely be obligated to 
implement a comprehensive information security program incorporating the 
particular elements required under the Massachusetts information security law. 
Other Laws
Some additional U.S. laws may potentially apply to the collection and 
processing of mHealth data. These laws include the Stored Communications Act 
and the FTC Secure Disposal Rule. 
The Stored Communications Act42 (“SCA”) prohibits an entity that provides an 
electronic communication service (“Service”) from knowingly disclosing the 
contents of a communication that the Service is holding in electronic storage. 
Disclosure is, however, permitted if the Service obtains express consent for the 
disclosure from the originator of the communication or the addressee or intended 
recipient. Penalties for violation of the SCA consist of civil claims for damages. 
Assuming that mobile health technology providers are deemed to be Services 
under the SCA, such providers would need to be aware of their disclosures 
of consumer health and medical data and would need to avoid any knowing 
disclosures, particularly without consumer consent, in violation of the act.43
The FTC Secure Disposal Rule44 (“Rule”) applies to entities that maintain 
consumer information for business purposes and requires that they properly 
dispose of that consumer information to protect against unauthorized 
disclosure. While the Rule does not specify particular disposal procedures that 
qualify as “proper” disposal under the Rule, it does provide specific examples of 
proper disposal measures. Pursuant to the Rule, mHealth providers would be 
42 18 U.S.C. §§ 2701-2712.
43 The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-2522, also protects wire, oral, and 
electronic communications while in transit and may have some limited application to mHealth.
44 16 C.F.R. 682.
 28 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
obligated to implement proper, secure disposal procedures for any individual 
health and medical information about consumers of mHealth services that they 
may collect and store. 
Coverage of Data Protection Regulation
PERSONS/ENTITIES OBLIGATED TO COMPLY
HiPAA: HIPAA applies to “Covered Entities” under the statute. These include 
Health Plans, Health Care Clearinghouses, healthcare providers that transmit 
health information in electronic form, and “business associates” of those 
covered entities.
COPPA: COPPA applies to “Operators,” which includes a person or entity who 
operates a commercial website or online service that collects or maintains 
personal information, as defined under the statute, as well as a person or entity 
who collects personal information on behalf of an Operator.
FTC ACT: According to the FTC Framework, the FTC’s authority under the FTC 
Act applies to nearly all commercial entities that collect consumer data.
STATE LAWS: The applicability of state breach notification laws and information 
security laws varies by state. In general, these laws apply to any natural person 
or legal entity that “owns or licenses” personal information of state residents. 
COVERED DATA
HiPAA: HIPAA covers “protected health information” or “PHI”. Under the statute, 
PHI includes information that can be used to identify an individual and relates to 
an individual’s past, present or future medical condition, the provision of health 
care to an individual, and past, present and future payment for the provision of 
healthcare to the individual. This data can include an individual’s name, address, 
birth date, and Social Security Number. The final omnibus rule addresses the 
use and disclosure of genetic information.
COPPA: COPPA covers personal information from a child under the age of 13 and 
includes a broad range of data types, including first and last name, physical 
address, social security number, persistent identifier, videos, photographs, 
geolocation information, and information concerning the child or the child’s 
parent or legal guardian that is combined with an identifier.
FTC ACT: Based on the FTC Framework, the FTC’s authority pursuant to the FTC 
Act covers consumer data that can be linked to an individual consumer, as well 
as data about a specific computer or device (such as cookie data and Unique 
Device Identifiers (“UDIDs”) for mobile devices).
STATE LAWS: Both state information security and breach notification laws 
generally apply to “personal information”, which, on a high-level, consists of 
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 29
an individual’s name combined with other more sensitive data such as: social 
security number, driver’s license number, financial account number, and health 
or medical data.
SCOPE OF COVERAGE
HiPAA: The statute applies to a covered entity’s use and disclosure of PHI. 
COPPA: COPPA generally prohibits unfair or deceptive activities related to online, 
collection, use and/or disclosure of personal information from a child under the 
age of 13.
FTC ACT: The FTC’s authority under the FTC Act applies to data collection 
and use practices that could be deemed to constitute “unfair” or “deceptive” 
practices that may adversely impact consumers.
STATE LAWS: State breach notification laws generally apply to individuals and 
legal entities that “own or maintain” personal information (as defined by the 
statute and described generally above) about residents of the state.
INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS
HiPAA: The statute requires each covered entity to provide data subjects with a 
notice describing the entity’s privacy practices. HIPAA sets forth specific content 
requirements for these notices. In particular, the notice must describe the ways 
in which the covered entity may use and disclose protected health information. 
The notice must also describe an individual’s rights, including the right to 
complain to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to the 
covered entity if the individual believes that his or her privacy rights have been 
violated. The notice must include a point of contact for further information and 
for making complaints to the covered entity. Covered entities are obligated to 
act in accordance with their notices. HIPAA also specifies when and how such 
notices should be provided to individuals. A covered entity must also provide 
notice to an individual upon that individual’s request. In addition, entities that 
are covered by HIPAA are required to provide notification to affected individuals 
and to HHS if the entity discovers a breach of unsecured health information.
COPPA: Under COPPA, an Operator must post a prominent link to a notice 
regarding the Operator’s data collection and use practices on its website’s 
homepage and on any page through which personal information from children 
may be collected. The statute specifies the types of information that must be 
included in the notice. An Operator must typically also provide notice directly to 
a child’s parent or legal guardian before it collects personal information.
FTC ACT: In its Guidance, the FTC has called for greater transparency in the 
collection and use of data. Recently, the FTC has placed a particular emphasis 
on transparency by mobile applications. As part of promoting transparency, 
 30 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
organizations must issue privacy notices that are clear, conspicuous, and more 
standardized, especially mobile app developers and platforms. Organizations 
must also issue prominent disclosures to inform consumers of changes in the 
organization’s use of data and educate consumers about the organization’s 
privacy practices.
STATE LAWS: Generally, state breach notification statutes require that notice 
be provided to affected individuals, but states vary on the timing, format, 
and content requirements for the notice. Some states do not specify content 
requirements, and those that do vary with respect to those requirements. 
California’s content requirements provide that the notice include, at a 
minimum: (a) the name and contact information of the reporting person 
or business; (b) a list of the types of personal information that were or 
are reasonably believed to have been the subject of the breach; (c) if the 
information is possible to determine at the time the notice is provided, then 
any of the following: (i) the date of the breach, (ii) the estimated date of 
the breach, or (iii) the date range within which the breach occurred; (d) the 
date of the notice; (e) whether notification was delayed as a result of a law 
enforcement investigation, if that information is possible to determine at the 
time the notice is provided; (f) a general description of the breach incident, if 
that information is possible to determine at the time the notice is provided; 
and (g) the toll-free telephone numbers and addresses of the major credit 
reporting agencies if the breach exposed a social security number or a driver’s 
license or California identification card number.
The Massachusetts information security law does not contain notice 
requirements.
CONSENT REQUIREMENTS
HiPAA: A covered entity must obtain an individual data subject’s consent to 
disclose his or her PHI where disclosure is not otherwise provided for under the 
statute. In addition, a covered entity in a direct care relationship with an individual 
is required to make a good faith effort to obtain written acknowledgment from 
the individual that the individual received the entity’s HIPAA notice.
COPPA: Under COPPA, a child cannot validly consent to the collection of his 
or her information. An Operator must obtain consent from a parent or legal 
guardian. The Operator is required to make any reasonable effort to ensure that 
before personal information is collected from a child, a parent or legal guardian 
(i) receives notice as specified under the statute and (ii) authorizes any collection, 
use, and/or disclosure of the child’s personal information. The Operator must 
also provide an option to consent to the collection of the child’s data without 
also consenting to the disclosure of that data to a third party. Additionally, the 
Operator is required to take steps to ensure that the individual providing consent 
is the child’s parent or legal guardian, and the statute specifies acceptable forms 
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 31
of consent for this purpose. In some specific cases, the Operator may obtain 
consent after it collects the personal information.
FTC ACT: In its Framework, the FTC requires that organizations provide 
streamlined choices to consumers regarding the use of consumer data. In 
particular, the Framework provides that express consent must be obtained 
for the collection and use of health and medical data. With respect to mobile 
applications in particular, the Report provides that organizations should provide 
consumers with just-in-time disclosures and obtain express consent for the 
collection of “sensitive content”. The Report does not clearly define “sensitive 
content” but states that it includes geolocation data and generally includes data 
that other countries may identify as “sensitive.”   Additionally, the Framework 
requires obtaining consent in the event of material changes in the organization’s 
use of data.
STATE LAWS: Generally, neither state breach notification laws nor state 
information security laws contain consent requirements. For reference, both the 
California breach notification law and the Massachusetts information security 
law do not contain such a requirement.
DATA SECURITY OBLIGATIONS 
RETENTION
HiPAA: A covered entity may include particular record retention policies as part 
of its required security practices. However, HIPAA does not specify a clear time 
limit on the retention of PHI. HIPAA does require that  covered entity retain 
its privacy policies and procedures, privacy practices notices, disposition of 
complaints, and other documentation required under HIPAA for six (6) years 
after their creation or last effective date.
COPPA: COPPA does not provide specific limitations on retention of personal 
information. However, it does specify that personal information collected in 
certain circumstances without first obtaining consent must be deleted after 
it has been used for the purpose for which it was collected. The amendments 
to the Rule also require that Operators adopt reasonable procedures for data 
retention and deletion. In addition, the Operator must delete the child’s personal 
information upon a parent or legal guardian’s request at any time.
FTC ACT: The Framework provides that organizations must implement 
reasonable restrictions on the retention and disposal of the data once it is no 
longer needed for the legitimate purpose for which it was collected. However, 
the Framework specifies that retention policies should be flexible and related to 
the type of data retained.
STATE LAWS: State information security laws generally require reasonable 
security measures to protect personal information. The Massachusetts 
information security law does not contain express provisions around retention. 
 32 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
SECURITY (INCLUDING CLOUD STORAGE)
HiPAA: A covered entity is required to maintain reasonable and appropriate 
administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect PHI from 
unauthorized use or disclosure. The HIPAA Security Rule sets forth applicable 
security requirements.
COPPA: An Operator is required to establish and maintain reasonable procedures 
to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information 
that it collects from children.
FTC ACT: The FTC Framework provides that organizations must provide 
reasonable security to protect consumer data. The Framework also requires 
reasonable limitations on the collection of information to a level that is 
consistent with the context of the transaction with the consumer.
STATE LAWS: State information security laws generally require reasonable 
security measures to protect personal information. The Massachusetts 
information security law requires that every individual or entity covered by the 
law develop, implement, maintain, and monitor a comprehensive information 
security program applicable to any records containing personal information of 
Massachusetts residents, and the information security program must contain 
administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and 
confidentiality of the personal information. 
IDENTITY AND AGE VERIFICATION PRACTICES
HiPAA: HIPAA allows for parents to exercise the individual rights of their minor 
children, as the minor’s “personal representatives.”  
COPPA: As stated, COPPA prohibits collection of personal information from 
children under the age of 13 and provides steps for confirming the identity of 
the child’s parent or legal guardian for purposes of obtaining consent for the 
collection and processing of a child’s personal information.
FTC ACT: The FTC’s authority to enforce COPPA is established under the FTC 
Act. The FTC Framework also requires reasonable authentication procedures for 
verifying the identity of consumers seeking to access their data, based on a risk 
management approach with heightened risks related to sensitive data.
STATE LAWS: The Massachusetts information security law requires secure access 
control procedures, which could incorporate identity verification for individuals 
seeking to access their personal information.
BREACH NOTIFICATION OBLIGATIONS
HiPAA: Under the HITECH amendments to HIPAA, a covered entity is required 
to notify an affected individual in the event of a breach of unsecured PHI. In 
certain cases, the covered entity must also notify the Secretary of the U.S. 
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 33
Department of Health and Human Services as well as the media. Notice 
must be given without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 days 
following discovery of the breach.
COPPA: COPPA does not provide for a specific breach notification obligation.
FTC ACT: The FTC Guidance does not expressly provide for breach notification 
obligations. However, in practice, an organization could be deemed to violate 
the data security or transparency obligations under the FTC Framework if it fails 
to provide notification of a data security breach impacting consumer data.
STATE LAWS: State breach notification laws generally require an individual or legal 
entity that “owns or maintains” personal information, as defined by the particular 
statute, to notify impacted individuals of any data security breach, which 
generally consists of any unauthorized access or acquisition of such personal 
information that is unencrypted. As noted in other sections of this summary, the 
timing, format, and content requirements of the notice vary by state. 
DATA TRANSFERS (INCLUDING CROSS-BORDER)
HiPAA: HIPAA does not expressly require notice or consent upon data transfer. 
However, in general, if such a transfer is related to or necessary to complete 
one of the purposes for which disclosure is permitted under the statute, the 
covered entity may engage in that transfer. Where the statute does not provide 
grounds for such a transfer, the covered entity will be required to obtain the 
written authorization of the individual for the underlying disclosure to which 
the transfer is related.
COPPA: COPPA does not expressly require consent or impose restrictions on 
data transfer. However, an Operator must state in the required notice whether 
any personal information is transferred to third parties, the types of business 
engaged in by the third parties, the purposes for which the personal information 
is used by the third parties, and whether the third parties are subject to an 
agreement to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the personal 
information that they receive. 
FTC ACT: The FTC Framework requires that organizations disclose third party 
recipients of consumer data as part of their adherence to the transparency 
principle. In addition, the FTC Report provides that mobile app developers 
should consider using icons to indicate when data is being transferred. 
STATE LAWS: State breach notification and information security laws do not 
generally contain express requirements for notice or consent upon data transfer. 
In general, however, covered entities must comply with the requirements 
of the state breach notification and information security laws even where 
personal information has been transferred outside of the United States. 
The Massachusetts law does not contain any express provisions regarding 
 34 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
international data transfers. With respect to transfers to third parties in 
general, under the Massachusetts law, every information security program 
must include all reasonable steps to (i) verify that any third party service 
provider with access to personal information has the capacity to protect such 
information in the manner provided for in the Massachusetts Regulations and 
(ii) ensure that such third party service provider is applying security measures to 
personal information that are at least as stringent as those required under the 
Massachusetts Regulations. 
ENFORCEMENT SANCTIONS
HiPAA: Penalties for non-compliance with HIPAA may include civil monetary 
penalties of between $100 to $50,000 per violation with a cap of $1,500,000 
per calendar year. However, if a violation was not due to willful neglect and was 
corrected within thirty days after the entity knew or should have known about 
the violation, no penalty will apply. Alternatively, criminal penalties of a fine 
up to $50,000 and up to one year of imprisonment may apply. If the wrongful 
conduct involved false pretenses, the criminal penalties increase to a fine of 
up to $ 100,000 and up to five years of imprisonment. If the wrongful conduct 
involved the intent to sell, transfer or use PHI for commercial advantage, 
personal gain or malicious harm, the penalties increase further, to a fine of up to 
$250,000 and up to 10 years of imprisonment.
COPPA: Penalties for non-compliance with COPPA are provided for under the 
Federal Trade Commission Act, as a violation of COPPA is deemed to be an 
unfair or deceptive act. Penalties may include FTC enforcement actions and/or 
monetary penalties of $16,000 per violation.
FTC ACT: Penalties for violation of the FTC Act may include injunction and/or 
monetary penalties of up to $16,000 per violation. 
STATE LAWS: Penalties for non-compliance with state breach notification laws 
and state information security laws vary by state. Generally, penalties for 
non-compliance with state breach notification laws range from injunctions, civil 
penalties from $100 to $750,000 per violation (larger for continuing violations), 
and private rights of action. The California breach notification law provides for 
injunctions and private rights of action. Penalties for non-compliance with state 
information security laws generally provide for civil penalties ranging from 
$1,000 per violation and up to $750,000 per violation for continuing violations. 
The Massachusetts information security law provides for civil penalties of up 
to $5,000 per violation and may require the violator to pay reasonable costs 
of investigation and litigation for the violation. Additionally, the Massachusetts 
State Attorney General may bring an action and Massachusetts state courts 
may issue injunctions.

EUROPE
EUROPEAN UNION
EUROPEAN UNiON PRivACY iN BRiEF
— Omnibus data protection law that covers all types of 
personal information, but generally no separate law 
regarding health privacy.
— Generally, health data is classified as “sensitive data”, 
so processing health data is permissible only in limited 
circumstances.
— The transfer of data outside of the European Union may 
be prohibited unless the recipient country’s laws provide 
“adequate protection” for the data or the recipient otherwise 
addresses this restriction.
— The European Union may soon implement a Data Protection 
Regulation, which would impose the same data protection 
and privacy requirements for the entire EU.
Introduction to Applicable Laws 
Unlike the United States, Europe has an omnibus data protection law that covers 
all types of personal information, including health information. However, there 
is no separate law regarding health privacy specifically. This section summarizes 
the main aspects of the European omnibus law and of a representative group of 
member-state privacy legislation and how these laws may be applied to mHealth.
EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC
The European Union has adopted the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC 
(“Data Protection Directive”) in 1995. The Data Protection Directive sets the 
general principles and legal framework which had to be implemented into local 
law by the Member States. Hence, data privacy law is regulated ultimately at the 
national level. 
Under the Data Protection Directive, and under the Member States law 
implementing the Data Protection Directive, health data relating to an individual 
person qualify as so-called sensitive data. According to the Data Protection 
Directive, the processing45 of health data shall generally be prohibited, unless 
(i) the patient has given his explicit consent to the processing of his health data, 
45 The term “processing” in this context encompasses the collection, recording, organization, storage, 
adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure, dissemination, making available, alignment, 
combination, blocking, erasure or destruction of personal data collection.
 36 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
except where the local laws of the Member State exclude patient’s consent 
for such purpose, (ii) processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying 
out the obligations and specific rights of the data controller in the field of 
employment law in so far as it is authorized by national law providing for 
adequate safeguards, (iii) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests 
of the data subject or of another person where the data subject is physically 
or legally incapable of giving his consent; (iv) processing is carried out in the 
course of its legitimate activities with appropriate guarantees by a foundation, 
association or any other non-profit-seeking body with a political, philosophical, 
religious or trade-union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely 
to the members of the body or to persons who have regular contact with it in 
connection with its purposes and that the personal data are not disclosed to a 
third party without the consent of the data subjects, (v) the processing relates to 
health data which are manifestly made public by the data subject or is necessary 
for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, (vi) the processing 
is required for the purposes of preventive medicine, medical diagnosis, the 
provision of care or treatment or the management of health-care services, 
provided those health data are processed by a health professional subject under 
national law or rules established by national competent bodies to the obligation 
of professional secrecy or by another person also subject to an equivalent 
obligation of secrecy.
Proposed European Regulation on Data Protection
In January 2012, the European Commission released a draft European Data 
Protection Regulation which will at some point replace the Data Protection 
Directive. As opposed to an European directive, the proposed European 
regulation would apply immediately rather than needing to be implemented into 
local law by member states.  The main objective of the European Data Protection 
Regulation is providing uniformity, the same level of data protection throughout 
the European Member States and thereby a higher level of legal certainty by 
preventing substantial deviations due to the local implementation process.
The draft European Data Protection Regulation is currently being debated by 
the European Union but is not expected to come into effect before 2016.
Germany — Federal Data Protection Act
Germany has implemented the Data Protection Directive with the German 
Federal Data Protection Act (“German Data Protection Act”). The German 
Data Protection Act defines health data as “sensitive data”, which requires that 
organizations provide more comprehensive protection for health data. The 
processing of health data as sensitive data is generally only permissible if (i) the 
patient consented, (ii) the processing is necessary in order to protect vital interests 
of the patient or of a third party, in so far as the patient is unable to give his 
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 37
consent for physical or legal reasons, (iii) the health data concerned has evidently 
been made public by the patient, (iv) the processing is necessary in order to 
assert, exercise or defend legal claims and there is no reason to assume that the 
patient has an overriding legitimate interest in excluding such processing, (v) the 
processing is necessary for the purpose of scientific research, where the scientific 
interest in carrying out the research project substantially outweighs the patient’s 
interest in excluding the processing, and the purpose of the research cannot be 
achieved in any other way or would otherwise necessitate disproportionate effort, 
(vi) the processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive medicine, medical 
diagnosis, health care or treatment or the administration of health services and 
the processing of these health data is carried out by medical personnel or other 
persons who are subject to an obligation to maintain secrecy (Sec. 28 (6) of the 
German Data Protection Act).
UK Data Protection Act
UK has implemented the Data Protection Directive with the UK Data Protection 
Act 1998 (“UK Data Protection Act”). Sec.2 (e) of the UK Data Protection Act 
defines health data as “sensitive data”, which requires that organizations provide 
more comprehensive protection for health data. The processing of health 
data as sensitive data is generally only permissible if (i) the patient has given 
his explicit consent to the processing, (ii) the processing is necessary for the 
purposes of exercising or performing any right or obligation which is conferred 
or imposed by law on the data controller in connection with employment, (iii) 
the processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the patient 
or another person, in a case where (a) consent cannot be given by or on behalf 
of the patient, or (b) the data controller cannot reasonably be expected to obtain 
the consent of the patient, (iv) the processing is necessary in order to protect 
the vital interests of another person, in a case where consent by or on behalf 
of the patient has been unreasonably withheld, (v) the processing is carried 
out in the course of its legitimate activities by any body or association which is 
not established or conducted for profit, and exists for political, philosophical, 
religious or trade-union purposes, with appropriate safeguards for the rights 
and freedoms of data subjects, only relating to individuals who either are 
members of the body or association or have regular contact with it in connection 
with its purposes, provided the processing does not involve disclosure of 
the health data to a third party without the consent of the patient, (vi) the 
information contained in the health data has been made public as a result of 
steps deliberately taken by the patient, (vii) the processing (a) is necessary for the 
purpose of, or in connection with, any legal proceedings (including prospective 
legal proceedings), (b) is necessary for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, 
or (c) is otherwise necessary for the purposes of establishing, exercising 
or defending legal rights, or (viii) the processing is necessary for medical 
 38 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
purposes, including the purposes of preventive medicine, medical diagnosis, 
medical research, the provision of care and treatment and the management of 
healthcare services, and is undertaken by a health professional, or a person who 
in the circumstances owes a duty of confidentiality which is equivalent to that 
which would arise if that person were a health professional.
In addition to the UK Data Protection Act, the UK legislator has issued the 
Data Protection (Processing of Sensitive Personal Data) Order 2000 which sets 
out additional circumstances in which sensitive data may be processed. Such 
additional circumstances permit the processing of sensitive data for a range 
of other purposes, primarily purposes that are in the public interest and where 
patient’s consent cannot be obtained.
Coverage by Data Protection Directive
PERSONS/ENTITIES OBLIGATED TO COMPLY
Any natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which 
processes personal data, acting as a data controller or a data processor, must 
comply with the principles and requirements established by the Data Protection 
Directive and transported into local Member State law. 
PERSONAL DATA
Personal Data is defined as any information relating to an identified or 
identifiable natural person. An identified person is one who can be identified, 
directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to 
one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, 
cultural or social identity. Typically, any information that is associated with an 
individual’s name, address, phone number, email address, or date of birth is 
considered personal data if it is theoretically possible to identify the individual. 
SCOPE OF COVERAGE
The Data Protection Regulation applies to the collection, recording, 
organization, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, 
disclosure, dissemination, making available, alignment, combination, blocking, 
erasure or destruction of personal data (collectively “processing”), that is, 
basically anything one can do with data, provided the  processing is carried out 
by automatic means (IT-system, computers, mobile devices, etc.) or by a non-
automatic filing system (a structured set of personal data which are accessible 
according to specific criteria, whether centralized, decentralized or dispersed on 
a functional or geographic basis).
INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS
According to the Data Protection Directive, the patient must generally be 
informed prior to the processing of his health data about (i) the identity of 
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 39
the natural or legal person that processes the health data, (ii) the purposes 
of the processing for which the health data are intended, (iii) the recipients or 
categories of recipients to whom the health data is disclosed, (iv) whether the 
provision of personal data is obligatory or voluntary as well as the possible 
consequences if personal data is not provided, (v) the existence of the right to 
access to and the right to rectify the personal data.
CONSENT REQUIREMENTS
If the processing of health data cannot be justified by a statutory ground, (see 
above a. i. (ii) to (iv)) the Data Protection Directive requires that the patient’s 
consent to the specific processing activities must be obtained. The Data 
Protection Directive defines consent as any freely given specific and informed 
indication of the data subject’s wishes by which the data subject signifies his 
agreement to the processing of his personal data. Hence, in order to obtain valid 
consent, the patient must be informed comprehensively about the processing 
activities and be given the free choice whether or not he wants to consent.
DATA SECURITY OBLIGATIONS 
RETENTION 
Personal data, including health data, shall be kept in a form which permits 
identification of the patient for no longer than is necessary for the purpose for 
which the health data were collected or for which they are further processed. 
That is, once the purpose has been achieved, the health data must principally 
either be deleted or de-identified so that the health data cannot be associated 
with an individual.
SECURITY (INCLUDING CLOUD STORAGE)
According to the Data Protection Directive, the data controller must implement 
appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect the 
personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, 
alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, in particular where the processing 
involves the transmission of personal data over a network, and against all other 
unlawful forms of processing. Having regard to the state of the art and the 
cost of their implementation, such measures must ensure a level of security 
appropriate to the risks represented by the processing and the nature of 
personal data to be protected. Typically, the level of security must be higher for 
health data as sensitive data.
If a data controller (e.g., a physician or a hospital) engages a third party service 
provider to store the health data on external services, the data controller 
must (i) diligently choose a third party service provider that provides sufficient 
guarantees in respect of the technical and organizational security measures 
and (ii) ensure compliance with those technical and organizational security 
 40 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
measures. This requirement of diligently choosing and continually monitoring 
a third party service provider also applies to any sub-processors a third-party 
service provider engages. With respect to cloud solutions where numerous 
service providers are engaged, the data controller is strictly speaking required 
to diligently choose every single one of them and to continually monitor all of 
them. Hence, in practice it will be very difficult, even impossible to comply with 
those requirements if personal data is stored in a cloud solution.
BREACH NOTIFICATION OBLIGATIONS
The Data Protection Directive does not impose any general security breach 
notification provision. However, the EU Directive on privacy and electronic 
communication 2002/58/EC (“ePrivacy Directive”) provides that in case 
of a personal data breach, the provider of publicly available electronic 
communications services46 must, without undue delay, notify the personal 
data breach to the competent supervisory authority. Furthermore, in case the 
personal data breach is likely to adversely affect the personal data or privacy 
of a subscriber47, the provider of publicly available electronic communications 
services must also notify the subscriber of the breach without undue delay. 
However, despite the lack of an overarching security breach notification 
requirement by the Data Protection Directive, several local Member States laws 
have imposed a notification obligation if certain categories of personal data 
are concerned. For example, the German Data Protection Act requires that a 
non-governmental body must notify both the patient and the responsible data 
protection authority without undue delay if it establishes that health data has been 
unlawfully transferred, or that unauthorized third parties have obtained the data, so 
that the patient’s rights are at risk of harm.
DATA TRANSFERS (INCLUDING CROSS-BORDER)
Transfer of health data to another body (including an affiliate or a branch of 
the original data controller) will typically require the patient’s consent unless 
the transfer is otherwise permitted by law. Furthermore, if the recipient is 
located in a country whose laws are not recognized as providing an adequate 
level of data protection48, an adequate level of data protection must either 
otherwise be established or an exception to the requirement of an adequate 
46 Electronic communications service means a service normally provided for remuneration which consists 
wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals on electronic communications networks, including 
telecommunications services and transmission services in networks used for broadcasting, but exclude 
services providing, or exercising editorial control over, content transmitted using electronic communications 
networks and services.
47 Subscriber means any natural person or legal entity who or which is party to contract with the provider of 
publicly available electronic communications services for the supply of such services.
48 Countries recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection are in particular countries within the 
EU/EEA, Argentina, Israel, Switzerland, and Uruguay.
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 41
level of data protection must apply. An adequate level of data protection can be 
established above all by means of a Safe-Harbor certification of the recipient49, 
the conclusion of so-called EU Model clauses, or within a group of company 
by means of binding corporate rules. An exception to the requirements of 
establishing an adequate level of data protection is given, amongst others, 
if (i) the patient consents to the transfer, (ii) the transfer is necessary for the 
performance of a contract between the patient and the data controller or the 
implementation of pre-contractual measures taken in response to the patient’s 
request, (iii) the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of 
a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject between the data 
controller and  third party, (iv) the transfer is necessary or legally required on 
important public interest grounds, or for the establishment, exercise or defense 
of legal claims, or (v) the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interest 
of the patient. 
ENFORCEMENT AND SANCTIONS
The Data Protection Directive does not set out a catalog of sanctions in case of 
a breach. Instead, the Data Protection Directive instructs the Member States to 
adopt suitable measures to ensure the full implementation of and compliance 
with the Data Protection Directive. For example, under the German und the 
French Data Protection Act, administrative fines of up to EUR 300,000 per 
incident can be imposed. In certain circumstances, criminal sanctions, such as 
imprisonment may also be imposed. 
ASIA-PACIFIC 
AUSTRALIA
Introduction to Applicable Laws
Similar to Europe, Australia has an omnibus data protection law, also covering 
health information, but has not enacted a specific health privacy law. The 
National Privacy Principles (“Principles”), incorporated into the Privacy Act50 set 
forth key principles regarding the handling of personal information by private 
sector legal entities.  The Principles address data collection, use, disclosure, 
access and correction, cross border data transfers, and sensitive data, in addition 
to other issues.
49 Only available for bodies in the U.S.
50 The National Privacy Principles will be replaced with the updated Australian Privacy Principles (“APPs”) 
under the recent amendments to the Privacy Act.  These changes will go into effect in March 2014.  The APPs 
are categorized into five groups of principles that are intended to cover the life cycle of handling personal 
data.  In total, there are thirteen principles across the five groups.
 42 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
AUSTRALiA PRivACY iN BRiEF
— Similar to Europe, has an omnibus data protection law that 
covers all types of personal information, but generally no 
separate law regarding health privacy.
— Consent is relevant to many decisions about how health 
information is collected, used or disclosed.
Australia Privacy Act, 1988 (“Privacy Act”) 
Section 95 of the Privacy Act enacts a statutory body which has the authority to 
issue guidelines with respect to collection of information for public health and safety.
All organisations that provide a health service are covered by the Privacy Act 
(whether or not they are small businesses). Organisations providing a health 
service include:
— Traditional health service providers such as private hospitals and day 
surgeries, doctors, and specialists
— Pharmacists
— Allied health professionals such as psychologists
— Complementary therapists like naturopaths and chiropractors; and 
— In some cases other services like gyms, fitness services and weight loss 
clinics, child care, and schools (if they provide a health service and hold 
health information).
Health information is personal information: 
— Individual’s health or disability at any time (that is, past, present or future)
— Individual’s expressed wishes regarding future health services
— Health services provided, or to be provided, to the individual
— Collected whilst providing a health service; or 
— Collected in connection with the donation or intended donation of body 
parts and substances. 
Consent Requirements
Consent is relevant to many decisions about how health information is collected, 
used, or disclosed. Consent is not, however, required by the Privacy Act in all 
situations. The Privacy Act states that, in the context of the National Privacy 
Principles, consent can be express or implied. Express consent is given explicitly, 
either orally or in writing. Implied consent is an agreement that can be inferred 
from an individual’s conduct. 
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 43
The key elements to consent are: 
— It must be provided voluntarily
— The individual must be adequately informed; and
— The individual must have the capacity to understand, provide and 
communicate their consent.
Data Security Obligations
RETENTION (INCLUDING CLOUD STORAGE)
Health information is highly valuable for many reasons, most importantly for an 
individual’s on-going health care, but sometimes also for wider public health 
and safety reasons. Some State and Territory legislation, or guidelines issued by 
health professional organisations, require or recommend the retention of health 
information by health service providers for varying periods of time.
Under National Privacy Principle 3 health service providers must take 
reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information they collect, use, or 
disclose is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. 
SECURITY
National Privacy Principle 4 requires that a health service provider take 
reasonable steps to: 
— Protect the health information it holds from misuse and loss, as well as 
from unauthorised access, modification, or disclosure; and 
— Destroy or permanently de-identify health information that is no longer 
needed.
IDENTITY AND AGE VERIFICATION PRACTICES
National Privacy Principle 8 sets out a health service provider’s obligation to 
make available to individuals the option of not identifying themselves when 
entering transactions with the provider, wherever this is lawful and practicable. 
BREACH NOTIFICATION OBLIGATIONS
Not applicable
Data Transfers (including cross-border)
Under National Privacy Principle 9, a health service provider may transfer 
personal information outside of Australia only under certain, specified 
circumstances.  These circumstances include where the recipient is subject 
to local laws that provide protections for personal information that are 
substantially similar to the protections under the Privacy Act, the affected 
individual consents to the transfer or the health services provider has taken 
 44 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
reasonable steps to ensure that the recipient will not handle the data in any way 
that will violate the Principles.51
JAPAN
JAPAN PRivACY iN BRiEF
— Japan employs a hybrid approach with industry-specific (or 
sectoral) privacy laws and a limited overarching privacy law.
— Japan’s overarching privacy law applies to business operators 
that collect and store Personal Information on databases of 
more than 5,000 individuals.
— Generally requires the database operator to notify data 
subjects of the purpose of use of the Personal Information 
collected and obtain consent under certain limited 
circumstances.
— The law does not specifically address cross-border data transfers.
Applicable Law
The Act on the Protection of Personal Information (Act No. 57 of 2003) (the 
“Law”) came into full effect on April 1, 2005.  The Law establishes procedures 
for issuing rules for specific industrial sectors.  Multiple government agencies 
that are responsible for the particular sectors have issued a number of 
guidelines pursuant to the Law’s procedures.
Coverage
The Law applies to business operators that collect and store Personal 
Information on a database (“Data Controllers”).  However, the Law does not 
apply to Data Controllers whose databases hold data about no more than 
5,000 individuals on any given day in a six-month period.
The Law covers “Personal Information,” which it defines as “[any] information 
that may make a living individual distinguishable from others.”  Personal 
Information would therefore cover a person’s name, address, birth date, 
birth place, phone number as well as medical history.  The Law distinguishes 
Personal Information from “Personal Data,” which applies to information about 
the Data Controller’s database.
51 Principle 8 of the new Australian Privacy Principles (“APPs”) slightly modifies the conditions for cross-border 
transfer.  Principle 8 first requires that the entity making the transfer take steps to ensure that the recipient 
of the data will not violate the APPs and then sets out exceptions to this requirement.  The exceptions, 
similar to the conditions for disclosure under National Privacy Principle 9, include informed consent from the 
individual whose data is subject to the transfer that the transferring entity need not take steps to ensure that 
the recipient complies with the Principles. 
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 45
Because the Law applies to medical history as covered Personal Information, 
the Law would generally apply to mobile health providers that store individual 
medical information on their databases, provided the health providers maintain 
records for over 5,000 individuals at one time.
Consent Requirements
Upon collecting Personal Information, the Data Controller must notify the data 
subjects of the purpose of use for the Personal Information collected.   
In general, a Data Controller must obtain express consent from data subjects  
if the Data Controller intends to use the Personal Information in any manner  
that is outside of the scope of the Data Controller’s specified purpose or 
purposes of use.  
Right to Access and Correct
In general, the Data Controller must disclose to data subjects, in writing or 
another means acceptable to the data subjects, the Personal Information 
processed upon their request.
If the Personal Information is found to be incorrect, the Data Controller must 
correct it within the scope of the specific purpose or purposes of use.
Data Security Obligations
The Law requires the adoption of technical, organizational and personnel 
security control measures to prevent leakage, loss or damage of Personal 
Information.  
Data Transfers
The Law does not specifically address cross-border data transfers.
With respect to transfers to third-party processors, the Data Controller is 
required to exercise supervision over third-party processors to ensure the 
security of the Personal Information.  
Enforcement and Sanctions
In the event of a data security breach, the relevant government agencies may 
collect reports from, advise, instruct and/or give orders to a Data Controller.  
If the Data Controller fails to comply with an administrative order, the Data 
Controller may be subject to penalties including imprisonment not exceeding 
six months or a monetary fine not exceeding ¥300,000.  In addition, employees, 
agents or representatives of the Data Controller who violate the Law in the 
course of their duties and fail to comply with administrative orders  may 
be subject to the same range of penalties.  Where an employee, agent or 
representative of the Data Controller is subject to such penalties, the Data 
Controller may also be subject to a monetary fine not exceeding ¥300,000.
 46 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
The Data Controller may also be required to pay compensation damages to 
affected data subjects as a result of tort or contract claims under the Japanese 
Civil Code.  The Data Controller may also be required to compensate data 
subjects for reputational damages.
SINGAPORE 
SiNGAPORE PRivACY iN BRiEF
Singapore’s new law follows the European approach and constitutes an 
omnibus data protection law with cross-border transfer restrictions and 
specific notice and consent requirements.
Applicable Law
The Personal Data Protection Bill was passed in Parliament on 15 October 
2012, and will be known as the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”) once it 
becomes an Act of Parliament. The PDPA came into force in January 2013.
The purpose of the PDPA is to regulate the collection, use and disclosure of 
personal data by organizations in a manner that recognizes both the right of 
individuals to protect their personal data, as well as the need of organizations to 
collect, use or disclose personal data. 
The PDPA will be implemented in phases over 18 months, to allow organizations 
time to implement the necessary measures to comply with the PDPA.
Scope
The PDPA applies to all persons, companies and other organizations in 
Singapore, subject to certain exceptions in the public sector, such as the 
Government or any statutory body.
Personal data is widely defined in the PDPA. It refers to all data (in electronic 
or non-electronic form), from which an individual, living or deceased, can 
be identified, whether from that data or from other information which the 
organization has or is likely to have access. 
The PDPA is intended to prescribe the baseline requirements for processing of 
personal data by organizations, and does not recognize a special category of 
personal data as sensitive personal data.
Consent Requirements
The PDPA requires that an individual’s consent be obtained before an 
organization can collect, use, or disclose personal data unless required or 
authorized under the PDPA or any other written law. There are two forms 
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 47
of consent – express and implicit. In the case of minors under the age of 18, 
consent can be given by an authorized representative (e.g., a parent or legal 
guardian, under a power of attorney, or any person with written authorization to 
act on an individual’s behalf).
As a safeguard, an organization may collect, use, or disclose personal 
data about an individual only if the individual has been informed, and for 
the purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the 
circumstances.
The PDPA provides for some exceptions from obtaining consent, including but 
not limited to:
— Situations where the collection of personal data is necessary to respond to 
an emergency that threatens the life, health, or safety of the individual or 
another individual 
— By employers for purposes of managing or terminating an employment 
relationship
— Disclosure to a public sector or law enforcement agency
— Disclosure pursuant to a subpoena, warrant, or court order
— Disclosure of personal data of an organization’s employees, customers, 
or shareholders to a prospective purchaser in a merger or acquisition 
transaction, provided that such information should be destroyed or 
returned if the transaction falls through.
An individual, upon giving reasonable notice to the organization, may withdraw 
the consent. Once withdrawn, the organization shall cease collecting, using, or 
disclosing the personal data.
Right to Access and Correct
Individuals have rights under the PDPA to:
— Request information about their personal data that is in the possession or 
control of an organization
— Obtain information about the ways which their personal data has been or 
may have been used or disclosed by the organization
— Request an organization to correct an error or omission in the personal 
data about the individual that is in the possession or under the control of 
the organization.
The organization is obliged under the PDPA to:
— Respond to the individual as soon as reasonably possible, assist the 
individual to obtain access to the personal data collected, and provide the 
individual with information about the ways in which such personal data has 
been used and to whom the personal data has been disclosed, subject to 
various exceptions
 48 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
— Correct the personal data as soon as possible and send the corrected 
personal data to every other organization to which the personal data was 
disclosed by the organization within a year before the correction was made, 
unless there are reasonable grounds that a correction should not be made.
Data Security Obligations
Obligations imposed on the organization under the PDPA to ensure that the 
personal data is properly cared for:
— ACCURACY OF PERSONAL DATA Organizations must make a reasonable 
effort to ensure that the personal data collected is accurate and complete, 
if the personal data is, among other things, likely to be used by the 
organization to make a decision that affects the individual to whom the 
personal data relates
— PROTECTiON OF PERSONAL DATA Organizations must protect personal 
data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security 
arrangements to prevent unauthorized access, collect, use or similar risks
— RETENTiON OF PERSONAL DATA Organizations must delete or anonymise 
documents containing personal data as soon as it is reasonable to assume 
that the purpose of collecting the data is no longer served by its retention, 
and retention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.
An organization is required to protect personal data in its custody or under 
its control by putting in place reasonable security measures to prevent 
unauthorized access to or use of such data. However, the PDPA does not 
prescribe any specific methods of securing personal data or specific standards 
that organizations need to adhere to.
Breach notification requirements are not covered in the PDPA. However, specific 
requirements for particular industries may be imposed by sectoral laws, codes 
of practice, or guidelines. 
Data Transfer (including cross-border)
The PDPA adopts a “principle-based approach” and provides that organizations 
transferring personal data outside of Singapore are required to ensure that 
appropriate measures are put in place to safeguard the personal data. 
In general, organizations are not allowed to transfer any personal data 
to a country or territory outside Singapore except in accordance with the 
requirements prescribed under the PDPA. This is to ensure that personal data is 
accorded a similar level of protection under the PDPA even if it was transferred 
outside Singapore. 
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 49
Enforcement and Sanctions
A Personal Data Protection Commission will be set up to undertake education 
and awareness efforts and oversee the implementation of the PDPA. Powers of 
the commission include:
— Review of complaints
— Giving directions to remedy non-compliance
— Imposing a financial penalty of up to S$1 million
— Imposing criminal penalties on organizations or individuals who obstruct 
the Commission in the performance of its duties or functions, or knowingly 
or recklessly make false statements to mislead the Commission, or for 
failure to comply with an order issued by the Commission.
In order to keep compliance costs down for organizations, the Commission 
will adopt a complaint-based approach in exercising its oversight duties, and 
will only investigation cases of non-compliance where a complaint is filed. 
Organizations will not be required to submit reports to, or be audited by, the 
Commission on a regular basis.
The PDPA also enables individuals to seek redress against an organization for 
breach of the PDPA via civil proceedings.
LATIN AMERICA
ARGENTINA
ARGENTiNA PRivACY iN BRiEF
— Argentina also has an omnibus data protection statute and 
follows the European approach.
— Express consent from the data owner is generally required 
when collecting “sensitive data”, including health data but 
there are exceptions for some health care professionals.
— Data owners have the right to request and obtain information 
on their personal data that is included in a data bank.
 
Applicable Law
Personal data protection is regulated by the Personal Data Protection Law 
(“PDPL”) No. 23.326, which became effective on 10 November 2000, and was 
restated by Regulatory Decree No. 1558/2001 (“Decree”).
 50 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
The Argentine Constitution (“Constitution”) also provides for a special judicial 
remedy known as “habeas data” to protect personal data, thereby upgrading 
the protection of personal data to the category of fundamental rights.
The PDPL, together with the Decree, the Constitution and certain resolutions 
issued from time to time by the Argentine Protection Authority, govern the 
protection of personal data in Argentina.
Scope
The PDPL applies to anyone owning a database, including individuals or legal 
entities, either public or private.
The PDPL defines personal data as information of any kind referring to 
ascertainable physical persons or legal entities. Argentine law protects 
personal data used for reporting purposes and recorded in data files, registers, 
databases, or by other technical means.
The PDPL also recognizes a special category of personal data as sensitive 
data, namely any personal data revealing racial and ethnic origin, political 
opinions, religious, philosophical or moral beliefs, labor union membership, and 
information concerning health conditions or sexual habits or behavior.
The PDPL provides that data owners cannot be compelled to provide sensitive 
personal data, except in health-related and union membership cases or where 
such information is necessary for employment purposes. It is prohibited to 
create files, banks, or registers storing information that directly or indirectly 
reveal sensitive personal data.
Consent Requirements
Under the PDPL, the treatment of personal data is unlawful when the data 
owner has not given his or her express consent in writing, or through any 
similar means, depending on the circumstances. The consent must appear in a 
prominent and express manner. Consent must be an informed consent, and is 
revocable by the data owner.
There are however some exceptions set out in Section 5, Paragraph 2 of the 
PDPL. Consent shall not be deemed necessary when personal data:
— Is secured from a source of unrestricted public access
— Is collected for the performance of the duties inherent in the powers of the State
— Consists of lists limited to name, national identity card number, taxing 
or social security identification, occupation, date of birth, domicile, and 
telephone number
— Is necessary for the development or compliance of a contractual, scientific, 
or professional relationship with the data owner.
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 51
The PDPL requires express consent from data owners for the processing of 
sensitive personal data. Exceptions to this rule are:
— Processing of sensitive personal data for reasons of general interest 
authorized by applicable laws
— Processing of sensitive personal data for statistical or scientific purposes, 
provided that data owners cannot be identified
— Processing of sensitive personal data referring to records on criminal or 
other offences, provided that the same is processed only by competent 
public authorities within the framework established by applicable laws and 
regulations
— Processing of sensitive personal data relating to the physical or mental 
conditions of patients by public or private health institutions, and medical 
science professionals, in pursuance of the principles of professional secrecy.
There is no provision in the PDPL that specifically addresses consent 
requirements for minors.
Whenever personal data is requested, data owners must be previously notified 
in an express and clear manner:
— The purpose for which the data shall be treated and to whom the data will 
be addressed
— The existence of the relevant data file, register, or bank, whether electronic 
or otherwise, and the identity and domicile of the person responsible
— The compulsory or discretionary character of the answers to the 
questionnaire the data owner is presented with, in connection with sensitive 
personal data
— The consequences of providing the data, or of refusing to provide such data 
or of providing inaccurate data
— The avenues available to the data owner to exercise his or her right of data 
access, rectification, or suppression.
Disclosures of Personal Data
Personal data may be disclosed only to meet the purposes directly related to the 
legitimate interests of the person responsible for the data file and the recipient 
and with the data owner’s consent. The data owner must be informed about 
the purpose of such communication and the identity of the intended recipient. 
Consent of the data owner for such disclosure is revocable.
Consent is not required when:
— A law so provides
— There exists circumstances set forth in Section 5, Paragraph 2 of the PDPL 
— Communication of the data takes place directly between government 
agencies, to the extent of their corresponding competencies
 52 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
— The data communicated is health-related personal data, and it is necessary 
to communicate such data for public health or emergency reasons, or 
for conducting epidemiological surveys, provided the identity of the data 
owner is kept confidential.
Right to Access and Correct
Data owners have the right to request and obtain information on their personal 
data included in public or private data registers or banks with reporting 
functionality. They must be provided the requested information within 10 
calendar days of making such request, or the data owner may commence 
habeas data proceedings to protect his/her personal data.
All persons have a right to rectify, update and when applicable, suppress or 
keep confidential their personal data included in a data bank, except that such 
suppression must not be effected if it could cause harm to the rights or legitimate 
interests of third parties, or a legal obligation exists to preserve such data.
The person responsible for or the user of the data bank must proceed to 
rectify, update or suppress the personal data belonging to the data owner by 
performing the operations necessary for such purpose within five business days 
of receipt of the complaint or notice of the mistake or false information.
Non-compliance with this obligation within the time stipulated above will enable all 
data owners to commence habeas data proceedings to protect their personal data.
The person responsible for or the user of the data bank must notify recipients of 
the rectified or suppressed data within five business days of the rectification or 
suppression.
The persons responsible for or users of public data banks may deny the access 
to or the rectification or suppression of personal data in the following cases:
— Based on national defence, public order and safety grounds
— For the protection of rights and interests of third parties
— When such data could hinder pending judicial or administrative 
proceedings relating to the compliance with tax or social security 
obligations, the performance of health and environment control functions, 
the investigation of crimes, and the verification of administrative violations.
Data Security Obligations
The person responsible for or the user of data files must take such technical 
and organizational measures as are necessary to guarantee the security 
and confidentiality of personal data, in order to avoid their alteration, loss, 
unauthorized consultation or treatment. These measures should also allow for 
the detection of any intentional or unintentional distortion of such information.
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 53
Under Section 9 of the PDPL, it is prohibited to record personal data in files, registers 
or banks that do not meet the requirements of technical integrity and security.
There is no specific mandatory obligation under the current law to notify the 
authorities of a security breach. Practically, in the event of a security breach, the 
Argentine Protection Authority (“Authority”) usually initiates an investigation to 
confirm whether the company affected by the security breach has adopted the 
security measures required by the PDPL and other regulations enacted by the 
Authority.
There is also no obligation under the PDPL to notify consumers about a security 
breach. However, companies affected by a security breach usually consider 
reporting the incident to their customers to allow them to adopt the appropriate 
course of action to protect their information and minimize damages. 
Where the data security breach affects information that has been registered 
with the Authority (e.g., a database), such an incident must be reported to the 
Authority. The Authority generally requests the company to clearly explain the 
details of the security methods that are implemented to prevent third parties 
from using private information, and may punish the company if it concludes that 
the company has not implemented appropriate technical and organizational 
security methods.
Data Transfer (including cross-border)
The transfer of personal data to countries which do not provide adequate levels 
of protection is prohibited.
Prohibition shall not apply in the following circumstances:
— International judicial co-operation
— Exchange of medical information, when so required for the treatment of the 
data owner
— Exchange of medical information in case of an epidemiological survey, 
provided that the identity of the data owner is kept confidential
— Stock exchange or banking transfers in pursuance of applicable laws
— When the transfer is agreed upon within the framework of international 
treaties signed by Argentina.
When the transfer is made for international co-operation purposes between 
intelligence agencies in the fight against organized crime, terrorism, and drug-
trafficking.
Enforcement and Sanctions
The Authority may impose the following administrative sanctions for non-compliance:
— Warnings
 54 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
— Suspensions
— Fines ranging between 1,000 pesos and 100,000 pesos
— Closure or cancellation of the file, register, or database
The Authority actively conducts audits to confirm if processors of personal data 
comply with security obligations.
The following criminal penalties may also be imposed under the Argentine 
Criminal Code:
— Imprisonment for a term of one month to two years for anyone who 
knowingly inserts or has false information inserted in a personal data file
— Imprisonment for a term of six months to three years for anyone who 
knowingly provides a third party with false information contained in a 
personal data file
— Imprisonment for a term of six months to three years for anyone who:
» Knowingly and unlawfully, or violating data confidentiality and security 
data systems, breaks in any way into a personal data bank
» Discloses to third parties information registered in a personal data bank 
which should be kept secret by provision of law.
MEXICO
MExiCO PRivACY iN BRiEF
Mexico’s relatively new law (effective since 2010) follows the European 
omnibus approach.
Applicable Law
Federal Law for the Protection of Personal Data Held by Private Individuals (Ley 
Federal de Proteccion De Datos Personales en Posesion de los Particulares 
(“LFPDP” or “the Act”), effective July 6, 2010. The Ministry of Economics 
is responsible for disseminating information on obligations related to the 
protection of personal data to domestic private enterprise and international 
enterprise with business activity in Mexico.
Scope
The act applies to the processing of personal data by companies and persons 
on Mexican territory regardless of where the data subjects reside. As a 
consequence, Mexican-based Internet companies have to comply with the 
Mexican law regarding any personal data they collect on non-Mexican users. 
Also, a Mexican parent company would have to comply with the law with respect 
to data collected from employees of its foreign subsidiaries; however, the 
statute does not expressly extend to the processing of personal data relating to 
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 55
Mexican residents by companies acting outside of Mexico. Therefore, it is likely 
that a U.S.-based Internet company would not be required to comply with the 
Mexican law as to data submitted by Mexican Internet users. 
General Principles
The Mexican law follows the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (“OECD”) Guidelines and addresses the following principles: 
Notice – The privacy notice plays an important role because it can be used to 
solicit tacit consent.  Data subjects should be given notice when their personal 
data is being collected, including the following elements: (i) the identity and 
address of the data collector; (ii) the purposes for the collection of personal 
data; (iii) the options and means implemented by the data collector to limit the 
disclosure or use of the data; (iv) the mechanisms that the data subjects can 
follow to request access, correction, cancellation and opposition as provided by 
the data protection law; and (v) the process through which the data collector will 
communicate to the data subjects the changes in the privacy notice.
— Purpose – Personal data should only be used for the stated purposes and 
not for any other purposes
— Consent – Personal data should not be disclosed without the data subject’s 
consent
— Security – Personal data should be kept safeguarded from potential abuses
— Disclosure – Data subjects should be informed about the identity of the 
data collector
— Access – Data subjects should be allowed to access their data and make 
corrections to any inaccurate data
— Accountability – Data subjects should have a method available to them to 
hold data collectors accountable for breaches of the above principles.
Coverage
The Act covers processing of personal data by individual persons or private 
legal entities, with the exception of credit reporting companies and private 
individuals collecting and storing exclusively for personal use without purposes 
of disclosure or commercial use.
As under European Union law, the terms “processing” and “personal data” 
are defined broadly and cover “the procurement, use (including any access, 
management, transfer or disposal), disclosure or storage of personal data by any 
means “ of any” information concerning an identified or identifiable individual.” 
Mexico also follows the European approach to generally prohibit the processing 
of personal data, as a default, by requiring that one of the following conditions 
is met: (i) consent; (ii) a necessity under contract or statute; or (iii) superseding 
interests based on a balancing test of interest and emergency situations. With 
 56 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
respect to data available from public sources, Mexico is more lenient than 
Europe and generally permits processing of such data without consent or other 
justification.
Interestingly, the new Mexican law refers to data subjects as “titulares;” (i.e., the 
“owner”) but the statute itself does not create property rights in personal data 
for data subjects, except if the data consists of a photograph of the subject.
Consent Requirements
Where consent of the data subject is required, consent may be given verbally, 
in writing, by electronic or optical means or any other technology or by 
unmistakable means. If the data subject receives a privacy notice and does not 
object to the terms of the notice, it is understood that the data subject has given 
tacit consent.
Consent may be revoked at any time, but the revocation cannot be applied 
retroactively.   The data controller must set out revocation mechanisms and 
procedures in the privacy notice.
Express consent is required before an organization may process sensitive 
personal data. “Sensitive personal data” is defined as “Personal data touching 
on the most private areas of the data owner’s life, or whose misuse might lead to 
discrimination or involve a serious risk for said data owner. In particular, sensitive 
data is considered that which may reveal items such as racial or ethnic origin, 
present and future health status, genetic information, religious, philosophical 
and moral beliefs, union membership, political views, sexual preference”. The 
privacy notice must expressly state that the organization collects and processes 
sensitive data.
Although generally data owners have the right to cancel their own data, 
the data controller is not obligated to cancel personal data when it is 
subject to processing for medical diagnosis or prevention or health services 
management, provided such processing is done by a health professional 
subject to a duty of secrecy.
Data Security Obligations
The Mexican law provides for much broader notification obligations than 
U.S. state laws and the laws currently considered or recently enacted in 
Europe. Breaches to the security of personal data that affect the patrimonial 
or moral rights of data subjects in a material manner must be immediately 
communicated to the data subjects.
Additionally, personal data must be deleted if it is no longer required for the 
purposes indicated in the privacy notice provided to the data subjects. 
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 57
Similar to European law and the general trend of evolving data security 
standards, all data processors must implement and maintain the administrative, 
technical, and physical measures that protect personal data from damage, 
loss, alteration, destruction or unauthorized use, access, or treatment. Security 
measures implemented must not be less than those used by data collectors to 
protect their own information and must also take into account the existing risk 
and the consequences derived from the sensitivity of the data and the prevalent 
technical development.
Data Protection Authorities / Data Protection Officers
Companies do not have to register databases or notify their data processing 
activities to any government authority. 
All data controllers and processors have to appoint a person or group as being 
responsible for personal data-related requirements; e.g., a company privacy 
officer. Employers have to appoint a person or establish a personal data 
department in charge of handling employees’ personal data and promoting the 
protection of the same. 
Data Transfer (including cross-border)
Companies may not transfer personal data within Mexico or abroad unless 
they notify such transfers in the applicable privacy notice to the data subjects. 
If so notified, transfers are permitted without consent of the data subjects in 
certain exceptional circumstances including, for example, when the transfer is 
made between companies of the same controlling group; otherwise, consent 
is required. Unlike under EU law, international transfers are not specifically 
restricted, and Mexican companies do not have to obtain government 
authorization or ensure “adequate safeguards” of data recipients outside Mexico.
Data processing will be done as agreed in the privacy notice, which shall contain 
a clause indicating whether or not the data owner agrees to the transfer of his 
data. The third party receiver will assume the same obligations as the data 
controller that has transferred the data.
ARTiCLE 37: Domestic or international transfers of data may be carried out 
without the consent of the data owner in the following cases:
4.a Where the transfer is necessary for medical diagnosis or 
prevention, health care delivery, medical treatment or health 
services management.
4.b Where the transfer is necessary by virtue of a contract executed or 
to be executed in the interests of the data owner between the data 
controller and a third party.
 58 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
Enforcement and Sanctions
Article 63 sets out nineteen separate examples of actions and inactions that 
are violations of the legislation. These actions include failure to respond to the 
data owner’s request to access, rectify, cancel, or object to the personal data 
held or the data controller acting negligently or fraudulently in processing and 
responding to requests for personal data access.
Violations are punishable by fines based on a multiple of Mexico City’s minimum 
wage and will vary depending on the seriousness of the violation. Fines range 
from 100 days to 320, 000 days of minimum wage. Those fines can be doubled 
for breaches involving sensitive personal data.
There are criminal sanctions including terms of imprisonment from 3 months to 
three years for any person who is authorized to process personal data for profit 
and causes a security breach affecting the databases under his custody.
Article 68 imposes a term of imprisonment from 6 months to five years for 
any person who, with the aim of achieving unlawful profit, processes personal 
data deceitfully, taking advantage of an error of the data owner or the person 
authorized to transmit such data.
As with the provisions for imposing fines, custodial sentences are doubled for 
breaches of sensitive personal data.
Data subjects have the right to enforce the protection of their personal data by 
complaining to the Mexican Institute for Access to Information and Personal 
Data (“IFAI”) when a data collector refuses to take certain actions that are 
required by law. Upon notice of a resolution from the IFAI, data collectors have 
10 days to comply with the resolution. The IFAI may initiate an action to verify 
compliance with the data protection law by any data collector upon petition 
by an interested party or ex-officio. The IFAI may also initiate at any time a 
conciliatory process between a data subject and a data collector. Data subjects 
may further seek damages from data collectors when they consider that they 
have suffered harm or losses derived from a breach by the data collector of the 
new Mexican data protection law. 
Compromising the security of a database containing personal data with the 
intention to profit is a criminal offense, which can be punished with up to three 
years of imprisonment and up to six years when sensitive personal data is involved. 
Furthermore, the act of collecting, using, disclosing or storing personal data 
through deceit and with the intention to profit is also considered a criminal 
offense punishable with up to five years of imprisonment, and up to 10 years 
when sensitive personal data is involved.

AFRICA
Compared to other regions, particularly Europe and certain sectors of Latin 
America and Asia that have implemented omnibus privacy regimes and other 
privacy laws, privacy law in Africa is relatively undeveloped.   Most African 
countries have not implemented comprehensive data privacy laws like those of 
Europe, and these countries have also not addressed privacy via a sector specific 
approach like that taken by the United States.  Note that some countries, such 
as Mauritius, Morocco and Tunisia, have enacted comprehensive data protection 
laws, and others such as South Africa (whose legislation is anticipated to 
become law later in 2013) and Kenya have developed draft bills that have not yet 
come into force and/or been finalized.  Implementation of omnibus privacy laws 
is not, however, the norm among African nations.  
Many African nations also have not enacted laws that provide broad protection 
to health and medical data such as that provided by HIPAA in the United States. 
That is not to say, however, that there is a complete void of privacy protections 
in Africa, particularly with regard to health and medical data.  Certain countries 
have constitutional protections for privacy, and health-related laws tend to focus 
on protecting the confidentiality of certain types of information, particularly 
health and medical data, data more specifically related to HIV/AIDS or other 
sub-categories of health and medical data, such as DNA or genetic information.  
Many of these laws impose their obligations on health and medical workers 
and other individuals who would normally have access to such categories of 
data and, in some countries, are supplemented with ethical codes of practice 
or similar rules for practitioners.  The penalties for violations of such laws and 
codes vary widely.
MEDiCAL ETHiCS
As we discussed in the introduction, confidentiality is an aspect of patient privacy. 
It is a promise by the healthcare provider and recipient of mHealth data that the 
information will be kept in strict confidence and used only for the purposes for 
which it was entrusted. Medical ethics codes have long recognized the physician’s 
obligation to safeguard a patient’s medical information and these codes have 
evolved with the profession. In some countries, these codes are exclusively 
regulated by the profession itself, while, in others, the code is part of the national 
law. In still other jurisdictions, these obligations form part of everyday practice 
but are not codified in a formal way. Within these examples, there a variety of 
approaches. While it is true that medical ethics do not traditionally apply beyond 
the healthcare provider and patient relationship (excluding, for purposes of 
mHealth, all the other actors identified in Figure 4 above), they still merit review 
 60 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
here. The long-established role of medical ethics and patient confidentiality can 
provide helpful guidance and context to the discussion of mHealth privacy law 
issues, particularly in terms of weighing competing interests. Also, strong and 
well-established ethical codes can serve to strengthen and buttress any efforts at 
mHealth privacy legislation. Likewise, entrenched views on patient privacy rooted 
in ethical codes may pose a serious obstacle to adoption of mHealth laws and 
regulations that run counter to these conceptions.
THE SOURCES OF MEDICAL ETHICS
The Hippocratic Oath provides, “What I may see or hear in the course of the 
treatment or even outside of the treatment in regard to the life of men, which 
on no account must be spread abroad, I will keep to myself, holding such things 
shameful to be spoken about.” “I Swear by Apollo Physician…”52  More recent 
articulations of the important healthcare ethical considerations involving privacy 
of medical information include that of Tom Beauchamp and James Childress, 
whose four principles (respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and 
justice) inform a broad definition of “privacy.”53  The authors consider various 
types of privacy, advocating that “those who propose policies carefully specify 
the conditions of access that will and will not count as a loss of privacy or a 
violation of the right to privacy” and “define the zones that are considered 
private …. and … identify interests that legitimately may be balanced against 
privacy interests.”54
To define such interests (and propose how to balance them) is to assume 
that privacy rights are not absolute and that they may give way under certain 
conditions – a belief that is not universally held. And even where privacy rights 
are not absolute, identifying conflicting interests does not provide a basis for 
determining when privacy rights must yield, as determinations of this kind are 
likely to be made based more on degrees of risks and harms to others than on 
the mere fact that the interest is involved. Furthermore, interests identified as 
sufficient to overcome privacy rights in one community may be inadequate in 
another. This is so, in part, because concepts of “autonomy” and “privacy” that 
might inform the ethical principles of a community may be based on sources 
unique to it – for instance, oral traditions and religious beliefs, practices, and 
texts, legal history and codified law, medical or health issues specific to the 
region, and other practical considerations or limitations.

Nevertheless, to greater or lesser degrees, common principles of health privacy 
are reflected in many jurisdictions’ medical ethics, be those codes discerned 
through practice, codified in law or written codes, or both. The following sections 
provide a brief overview of the disparate medical privacy ethics of various 
nations, illustrating both the difficulty of arriving at a common set of health-
privacy norms and the importance of understanding the role of cultural values 
in the development and implementation of health privacy policies.
A comprehensive overview of world medical ethics55 is beyond the scope of 
this section, but a brief consideration of health privacy ethics is informative 
for discerning the major principles and recognizing the differences that may 
exist among jurisdictions. The country-by-country illustrations presented here 
are not meant to imply that every nation adopts a single set of principles, as 
communities within nations may differ in their perceptions of health privacy 
and interest that may conflict with privacy rights. But a look at several nations’ 
principles of health privacy, limited as they are in drawing generalities, serves 
to illustrate both the common principles that have emerged and the diversity 
in approaches worldwide. Additional information on health-privacy ethics is 
provided in the next section, “Case Studies”.
THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND EUROPE
UNITED STATES 
The American Medical Association Principles of Medical Ethics (2001) provides, 
“A physician shall respect the rights of patients, colleagues, and other health 
professionals, and shall safeguard patient confidences and privacy within the 
constraints of the law.”56 The obligation of confidentiality in the United States is 
a longstanding one; for instance, the 1847 version of the Principles adopted by 
the AMA recognized that the law protected physicians against the obligation of 
disclosure:
Secrecy and delicacy, when required by peculiar circumstances, should be 
strictly observed … The obligation of secrecy extends beyond the period of 
professional services; — none of the privacies of personal and domestic life, 
no infirmity of disposition or flaw of character observed during professional 
attendance, should ever be divulged by him except when he is imperatively 
required to do so. The force and necessity of this obligation are indeed 
so great, that professional men have, under certain circumstances, been 
protected in their observance of secrecy, by courts of justice.

American Medical Association, Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical 
Association, May 1847, ch. 1, art. 1.57
Today, likewise, health privacy ethics in the United States may be seen to be 
reflected in the law, as highlighted by the enactment of the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) Privacy and Security Rules 
(which protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information and set 
national standards for the security of electronic protected health information) 
and the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (“PSQIA”) Patient 
Safety Rule (which protects identifiable information being used to analyze 
patient safety events and improve patient safety). These statutes and Rules 
may be said to reflect the principle that health professionals have an affirmative 
ethical obligation to protect patient health privacy and that the national 
government has an oversight obligation to ensure that these privacy obligations 
are met. Additionally, state governments may regulate health information even 
more strictly than does the federal government; for instance, several U.S. states 
have enacted statutes specific to HIV status and medical records, prohibiting 
HIV information from being disclosed even where a general release of medical 
information has been obtained (and requiring a specific release for disclosure of 
the information). 
Nevertheless, a patient’s privacy right is not absolute. To take once again the 
example of HIV status and medical information, U.S. healthcare workers are 
obligated to report HIV infections and AIDS cases to public health authorities, 
including, recently, the patient’s name and other identifying information. In 
addition, healthcare providers may, if they choose, disclose a patient’s HIV 
infection to a sexual or needle-sharing partner of the patient. The Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) has made specific recommendations 
for keeping reporting confidential and has recommended that anonymous 
testing for HIV continue to be made available. And again, some states, including 
California, have enacted laws requiring the patient’s informed consent before a 
healthcare provider warns a patient’s partner.58
CANADA 
The Canadian Medical Association Code of Ethics (1996), like the American 
Medical Association Code, requires physicians to “respect the patient’s 
right to confidentiality except when this right conflicts with [the physician’s] 
responsibility to the law, or when the maintenance of confidentiality would result 
57 Note that such protections against disclosure in the laws and rules that regulate court proceedings are 
essential to ensuring that privacy promises can be kept by those who make them.  If the courts do not 
recognize the confidentiality of certain types of mHealth data, this creates a significant vulnerability in the 
privacy ecosystem and undermines it as a whole.
58 California Health and Safety Code §§ 120975-121020.
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 63
in a significant risk of substantial harm to others or to the patient if the patient 
is incompetent; in such cases, [the physician must] take all reasonable steps 
to inform the patient that confidentiality will be breached.”59 The Code also 
requires physicians to “[d]isclose patients’ personal health information to third 
parties only with their consent, or as provided for by law.”60
The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) 
is a Canadian statute that codifies privacy protections based on the 10 privacy-
related principles forming the Canadian Standards Association’s Model Code for 
the Protection of Personal Information, which limits the collection and uses of 
health or other personal information. 
As in the United States, Canadian medical ethics and law recognize exceptions 
to the rule of health information confidentiality. HIV and AIDS cases must be 
reported to provincial health authorities. Canadian law also recognizes a “public 
safety” exception to the rule of confidentiality. Although physicians in Canada 
are not obligated to breach patient confidentiality to protect others, the law 
is apparently unfixed in this regard, and physicians may disclose HIV status to 
sexual or injection partners of an infected patient.61
EUROPE 
A country-by-country survey of the European Union62 and other European 
nations is beyond the scope of this section. As such, it aims only to provide a 
sampling of various jurisdictions’ position on medical ethics as related to privacy. 
The European Convention on Human Rights protects the right to respect for 
private and family life, and also protects confidential information.63 Ethical 
principles of privacy of medical and other personal information may be reflected 
in the European Commission’s Data Protection Directive, 95/46/EC, which 
regulates and limits the processing and disclosure of personal information 
within the European Union. Still, efforts have been made to recognize 
universal principles of health privacy ethics. The World Health Organization’s 
1994 Declaration on the Promotion of Patients’ Rights in Europe provides for

country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of

autonomy (“Everyone has the right to self-determination”) as well as privacy 
(“Everyone has the right to respect for his or her privacy.”).64 The Declaration, 
whose adoption is voluntary for Member States, sets forth several principles that 
reflect various nations’ medical and ethical codes involving health privacy: 
4.1 All information about a patient’s health status, medical condition, 
diagnosis, prognosis and treatment and all other information of a 
personal kind must be kept confidential, even after death.
4.2 Confidential information can only be disclosed if the patient 
gives explicit consent or if the law expressly provides for this. 
Consent may be presumed where disclosure is to other health care 
providers involved in that patient’s treatment.
4.3 All identifiable patient data must be protected. The protection 
of the data must be appropriate to the manner of their storage. 
Human substances from which identifiable data can be derived 
must be likewise protected.
4.4 Patients have the right of access to their medical files and 
technical records and to any other files and records pertaining to 
their diagnosis, treatment and care and to receive a copy of their 
own files and records or parts thereof. Such access excludes data 
concerning third parties.
4.5 Patients have the right to require the correction, completion, 
deletion, clarification and/or updating of personal and medical 
data concerning them which are inaccurate, incomplete, 
ambiguous or outdated, or which are not relevant to the purposes 
of diagnosis, treatment and care.
4.6 There can be no intrusion into a patient’s private and family life 
unless and only if, in addition to the patient consenting to it, it can be 
justified as necessary to the patient’s diagnosis, treatment and care.
4.7 Medical interventions may only be carried out when there is proper 
respect shown for the privacy of the individual. This means that a 
given intervention may be carried out only in the presence of those 
persons who are necessary for the intervention unless the patient 
consents or requests otherwise.
4.8 Patients admitted to health care establishments have the right to 
expect physical facilities which ensure privacy, particularly when

health care providers are offering them personal care or carrying 
out examinations and treatment.65
Many of these principles are reflected in the codified law in Member States. 
In the United Kingdom, General Medical Council (“GMC”) guidance provides 
that patients have a right to expect that their physicians will keep their medical 
information confidential.66 As in the United States and Canada, the obligation 
to protect confidential patient information is not absolute, and regulations 
recognize a reporting duty with respect to certain diseases. Also, as in the North 
American countries, a UK physician may alert a partner of an HIV-infected 
patient, regardless of whether the patient has given informed consent to the 
disclosure.67
In France, Article 4 of the Code of Medical Ethics promulgated by the Conseil 
National de l’Ordre des Médecins provides that professional confidentiality, 
instituted in patients’ interest, is obligatory for every physician within the 
conditions established by law.68 French Penal Code (Nouveau Code Pénal) 
Article 226-13 provides that the disclosure of confidential information acquired 
in any manner in one’s professional capacity or by reason of a function or of 
a temporary mission is punishable by one year’s imprisonment and a fine of 
15,000 euros.69 More specifically, a patient’s HIV status is strictly protected under 
the Ordre des Médecins, which forbids physicians from making disclosures to 
partners of HIV-infected individuals who oppose the disclosure.70 Data from 
a recent survey study supported the finding that most French physicians 
believe that breaching patient confidentiality is never acceptable, a view that is 
consistent with the official position of the Ordre des Médecins.71
LATIN AMERICA
BRAZIL
Healthcare workers in Brazil follow a strict code of medical ethics that precludes 
disclosure of patient information to any third party except where required by

69 Again, statutory provisions such as these provide “teeth” to the privacy and confidentiality laws and ensure 
that they will not be trumped by other interests without a careful analysis of the issues at stake.  Privacy law 
is unlikely to succeed in a vacuum without the support of other areas of the legal system.

law.72 Health privacy is protected by professional confidentiality obligations; 
health professionals take an oath to protect patient privacy upon graduating to 
practice.73 Medical confidentiality has historic origins and is ethically expressed in 
the Hippocratic Oath; the Medical Code of Ethics identifies standards governing 
professional conduct, including prohibitions and obligations related to privacy, 
as well as prerogatives of disclosure.74 A healthcare professional’s disclosure of 
patient information renders the professional subject to disciplinary action as well 
as criminal sanctions for harm caused to the patient, although such sanctions 
are rare and the bar against disclosure is not absolute where certain conflicts of 
interest arise.75 Moreover, the physician is in control of the disclosure where the 
patient has consented to same: “After [patient] consent, the revelation becomes 
only optional, never obligatory, the final decision being the doctor’s. It can be 
said that the consent for revelation results in the option of volitive deliberation.”76 
A fundamental consideration as to whether to breach privacy is the harm to 
third parties.77
The right to privacy is not absolute; exceptions exist at law. For instance, the 
Brazilian Health Ministry has recently indicated that it will require physicians to 
report all new cases of HIV infection; previously, the reporting requirement was 
restricted to patients diagnosed with AIDS.78
ARGENTINA
In 2001, the Argentine Medical Association (Asociación Médica Argentina), the 
primary professional association of physicians in Argentina, published a Code of 
Ethics for the Health Team (Código de Ética para el Equipo de Salud); a second 
edition was pubished in 2011.79 Chapter 7 of the Code sets forth the obligations 
of professional confidentiality as an ethical duty of the health team member 
that is essential to the profession.80 In addition to requiring the observation of 
data protection laws, Chapter 7 states that professional confidentiality is an

essential ethical duty of health team members and notes that revelation of a 
patient confidence to even a single person is punishable under the Argentinian 
Criminal Code.  The Code also provides that the confidentiality obligation 
does not dissolve upon the death of the patient.  Under the Code, in cases of 
pregnancy of an unmarried minor, the physician must remain silent.  The Code 
does, however, permit health team members to disclose health information to a 
patient’s closest relatives, or to others upon the patient’s consent.  Further, the 
Code recognizes certain exceptions to the rule of nondisclosure.  In particular, 
“social diseases” of alcoholism, drug addiction, and sexually transmitted 
diseases must not be disclosed, “provided that this does not represent a real 
and demonstrable loss to the patient, to a third person, or to the community.”81
MIDDLE EAST
SAUDI ARABIA
A healthcare ethics code informed by Shariah law, such as in Saudi Arabia, may 
favor a family-centered or paternalistic approach to disclosure.82 Data from one 
survey in Saudi Arabia, for instance, supported the conclusion that 67 percent 
of physicians and 51 percent of patients surveyed in Saudi Arabia would inform 
the patient in preference to the family of the diagnosis of incurable cancer. 
Additionally, 59 percent of surveyed physicians and 81 percent of surveyed 
patients would inform the patient’s family about the patient’s HIV status without 
first obtaining that patient’s consent.83
ISRAEL
Under Talmudic law, physicians may not share privileged information with their 
colleagues or anyone else if no benefit to the patient would result therefrom. 
However, if the maintenance of confidence might cause harm to another person, 
the latter may be informed. If the individual’s right to privacy conflicts with the need 
of society to prevent harm to others, the prohibitions against tale-bearing and evil 
gossip are waived and the information must be disclosed to protect others. The 
disclosure must be factual, accurate, and not exaggerated.84
These ethical standards may be reflected in Israel’s Patient’s Rights Act, 1996, 
which establishes the rights of every person who requests or receives “medical

care” (defined to include medical diagnostic procedures, preventative medical 
care, psychological care, and nursing) in Israel.85 The Act directs healthcare 
professionals to maintain the dignity and privacy of their patients during all 
stages of treatment.86
Administration of medical care generally requires the patient’s informed 
consent, although an exception may be made in the case of limited 
circumstances, such as an emergency.87 If the patient cannot give informed 
consent, a representative may be appointed to do so.88 Healthcare professionals 
must supply patients with “medical information” (i.e., information directly 
related to the patient’s state of physical or mental health, or treatment of such 
state) to allow the patient to make an informed decision as to treatment.89 For 
consent to be truly informed, healthcare professionals should provide medical 
information to their patients at the earliest possible stage, and in a manner that 
maximizes the patients’ ability to understand the information provided and 
make free and independent medical choices.90 However, where facts suggest 
that the provision of medical information is likely to cause severe harm to the 
patient’s mental or physical health, medical information may be withheld from a 
patient with approval by an ethics committee.91
Healthcare professionals are required to keep “medical records” (defined to 
include anything documenting medical information) identifying the patient, 
medical information, and treatment.92 (Generally, a patient may obtain his or 
her own medical records unless the information is liable to cause serious harm 
to his or her physical or mental health or to endanger his or her life.)93 Subject 
to certain specified exceptions, healthcare professionals are forbidden to 
disclose any patient information learned in the course of their duties.94 Medical 
information may be disclosed to a third party only if one of the following 
conditions is met: (i) the patient consents to the disclosure; (ii) the healthcare 
professional or facility is legally obligated to provide the information (to the 
government or the like); (iii) the disclosure is made for purposes of the patient’s 
treatment by another healthcare professional; (iv) an ethics committee approves 
disclosure for the protection of the health of others or the public (and the 
need for disclosure overrides the patient’s interest in non-disclosure); or (v) 
disclosure is for publication in a medical journal, research, or teaching purposes 
and all the patient’s identifying details are suppressed.95 Disclosures must be

limited to the necessities of the situation, and healthcare professionals should 
make every effort to protect the patient’s identity.96 Third parties to whom 
medical information is disclosed are charged with protecting the dignity and 
confidentiality of the patient in the same manner as healthcare professionals.97 
All medical facilities must train their staff to prevent inappropriate disclosure of 
patient information.98
ASIA
CHINA
In July 2012, the Ministry of Health for the People’s Republic of China issued 
a “Code of Conduct” to be followed by medical personnel, including hospital 
management, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other staff. A key provision 
of the Code provides requires such medical personnel to protect patients’ rights 
to informed consent and to keep patient information confidential. Nevertheless, 
unlike in the West, consent forms for medical treatment are frequently signed 
not by patients but by their families, a practice recognized in the Republic’s 
social practice and policies.99 This norm has the potential to breach patient 
privacy.100 HIV-positive status in China is highly stigmatized; nevertheless, 
patients’ families are often informed of the diagnosis.101
JAPAN
Physicians in Japan, likewise, have historically informed families of diagnoses 
and prognoses, at times even when patients themselves were not informed of 
such information.102 This was particularly true in cases of a highly stigmatized 
condition, such as HIV or psychiatric disorders.103 However, such practices are 
changing, with physicians increasingly engaging in candid discussion of medical 
information with their patients.104 On the other hand, failures of the Japanese

medical system to maintain patient confidentiality in the case of HIV status have 
been documented.105
AFRICA
The African Charter on Human and People’s Rights, or Banjul Charter, which 
has been ratified by more than 50 countries, omits an explicit right of privacy.106 
However, the right to privacy is reflected in some nations’ laws. In South Africa, 
for instance, patients’ right to privacy is recognized in the Constitution, which 
requires patients’ consent to disclose medical records, as well as in medical 
ethical rules of conduct limiting disclosures of information without patient 
consent except when required by statute or a court or where justified in the 
public interest.107 South African ethical guidelines provide for limited disclosures 
despite the general recognition of this privacy right; for instance, physicians may, 
at their discretion, disclose patients’ HIV status to partners at risk.108
In practice, patient confidentiality in various African countries, such as Uganda, 
is not always maintained by healthcare workers.109 But, generally speaking, in 
Africa, a person’s autonomy includes the right to privacy; hospital healthcare 
workers have an obligation of confidentiality with respect to patient information, 
diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of a patient’s illness unless the patient 
has given permission to disclose.110 Furthermore, because African societies are 
communal, relatives of a patient may request that healthcare professionals 
divulge information on the patient’s condition, treatment, and prognosis, and 
a refusal to divulge this information can lead to the patient’s being removed by 
such relatives from the hospital.111
Indeed, in some nations, competing interests may limit patients’ right to privacy.

philosophy, particularly among the Bantu-speaking peoples of Sub-Saharan

Africa; it consists of the principles of sharing and mutual caring.112 “The Ubuntu 
worldview has been recognized as the primary reason that South Africa has 
managed to successfully transfer power from a white minority government to a 
majority-rule government without bloodshed.”113 Under the concept of Ubuntu, 
“a person is a person through other persons,” a concept based on such values 
as humanity, caring, respect, compassion, and “ensuring a happy and qualitative 
human community life in a spirit of family.”114 Given these values, personal 
privacy may be subordinated in some cases to communal interests.115

CASE STUDIES FROM SELECT 
JURISDICTIONS IN AFRICA, 
ASIA, AND LATIN AMERICA
This section of the paper takes a closer look at the state of privacy law and 
any particular legislation and policy in the mHealth space in a select group 
of jurisdictions that have experienced significant growth in the adoption of 
mHealth products and services. We conducted a high-level gap analysis 
in consultation with local privacy attorneys in Tanzania, Uganda, Nigeria, 
Bangladesh, India, Peru, and Chile. The results of this analysis are summarized 
in this section.
BANGLADESH
In Bangladesh, there is no specific data protection law or privacy law that 
specifically applies to mHealth. In addition, Bangladesh has not implemented 
specific laws that govern the use and disclosure of health and medical data in 
general (i.e., an omnibus health data law similar to HIPAA in the United States). 
Certain protection for medical data (which would encompass certain types 
of mHealth data) is provided by the medical ethics rules established by the 
Bangladesh Medical Association (“BMA”). The Medical Practitioners Act does 
not provide for any secrecy of information or data protection or communication, 
but physicians are accredited under BMA, and they are bound by its codes and 
declarations. Under such rules, patient-specific medical data may be disclosed 
only to the patient except in certain specified situations, such as where there 
is a possibility of adverse effect on the medical condition of a patient. Strict 
secrecy is maintained over patients’ files, and relevant consents must be sought 
for information sharing when relevant. Note, however, that amalgamated and 
aggregated data are used routinely by laboratories and researchers on an 
anonymous basis. 
In addition to the protections established by the BMA, there are other, more 
general privacy protections established by Bangladeshi law that could apply to 
mHealth depending on the context: 
— The Information & Communication Technology Act provides perhaps the 
strongest general protection for mHealth data because it applies to any 
information stored electronically and prohibits unauthorized disclosure of 
 74 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
personal data stored in such electronic format without the relevant consent 
of the individual. Violations are subject to imprisonment and/or fines. 
— The Bangladeshi Constitution establishes a general right of privacy in 
correspondence and communications that presumably could be applied 
to health-related communications. Civil claims for damages may be 
imposed for violations of the right. 
— The Consumer Protection Act prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of 
personal data of consumers resulting in adverse consequences to the 
consumer. In addition general rules for loss and damages against any 
breach of contract/unlawful activities would be included. Violations are 
subject to imprisonment, fines, or both.
As a possible limitation on the right of privacy in communications including 
communications related to mHealth, the Bangladesh Telecommunications Act 
provides the Bangladeshi government the right to empower any of its agencies 
to record, prevent and collect information regarding communications made by 
any person through telephone for the purpose of protecting the security of the 
state and public tranquility. In order to administer this law, the Bangladeshi 
government can require the assistance of a service provider in the recording, 
blocking or collecting of the information at issue. 
In Bangladesh, healthcare workers are bound by ethical codes and the law 
to maintain the confidentiality of their patients’ health information where the 
patient has not consented to the disclosure; even family members are not to be 
given information about a patient’s medical history.116 But again, concern for the 
safety of others may warrant disclosure.117 This is of particular concern where 
certain conditions, such as HIV status, are heavily stigmatized.118
CHiLE
There is currently no law in Chile related specifically to the regulation of mHealth 
or related data. The Chilean Penal Code (Código Penal) requires that civil servants 
or professionals who reveal personal information be imprisoned and fined, while 
the Chilean Penal Procedural Code (Código Procesal Penal) compels health 
professionals to report any fact that may constitute the breaking of a law.119
Chilean Law No. 20.584 regulates the rights and obligations of people with 
regard to actions connected to their health service (the English translation of 
the law is, “The rights and obligations of people in regards to actions connected

to their health service” or “ROHSL”).  Under ROHSL, all information related to 
the clinical record of a patient and the studies and other documents wherein 
procedures and treatments are registered about a patient will be considered 
“sensitive data” under the Chilean data protection law (discussed below) and 
subject to the related protections, including the obligation to obtain consent to 
collection and disclosure and to secure such information electronically. 
Moreover, each health center in Chile, whether an outpatient center, hospital, 
or clinic, must clearly and visibly exhibit a “Charter of Patient Rights and 
Responsibilities” in addition to a book or other form for registering complaints. 
If a patient is not satisfied with a response, he or she may refer the matter to 
the Superintendent of Health. In addition, among the principal patient rights, 
the new law (enacted in October 2012) states that every person, irrespective of 
the healthcare provider, is entitled to receive the relevant healthcare services 
promptly and without any arbitrary discrimination, along with dignified 
treatment, spiritual company and assistance; comprehensible information on 
the diagnosis, treatment, and medication; and reservation of the clinical record.
ROHSL establishes the obligation for institutional providers, both public and 
private, to maintain an updated database and to make the records stored 
therein freely accessible (to the relevant individuals). The available information 
should include information about costs of services, supplies, and medication.
Health centers with a high number of indigenous clients must have facilitators 
who speak the indigenous language. The centers also must provide signs in the 
corresponding language as well as in Spanish.
ROHSL also sets out responsibilities for patients, including obligations to provide 
truthful information regarding identity, address, and sickness; to treat health 
staff with respect; to take care of the health center’s facilities and equipment; to 
respect the internal rules of the establishment as well as the certificate of their 
medical information; to be informed about facility’s hours of business, types 
of service, and forms of payment in force; and to become informed about the 
established procedures for lodging complaints and consultations.
Penalties for violation of ROHSL include penalties for violations of the data 
privacy law (see below). Violations would generally be assessed against public 
healthcare providers and medical practitioners (physicians).
Chilean Law 19.779 specifically protects the confidentiality of a patient’s HIV 
status, requiring health professionals who analyze fluids and communicate the 
information to maintain strict confidentiality.120
Chile has also implemented the Code of Ethics of the Medical Association of 
Chile (“CEMAC”), which applies to all medical practitioners (physicians) who are 
members of the Medical Association of Chile. Note, however, that membership 
in this association is not mandatory for practitioners. For members, CEMAC 
120 Id.
 76 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
requires that all heath practitioners ensure the confidentiality of all information 
that stems from professional services. This confidentiality duty also extends to 
all documentation in which clinical data, diagnosis, and prognosis are registered. 
Penalties for violation include a warning, censorship, a fine, suspension, ineligibility 
to hold union position, and expulsion from CEMAC.  Confidentiality may be 
appropriately and ethically breached in limited cases, most notably upon the 
diagnosis of certain illnesses, such as syphilis, that are required by law to be 
reported to the authorities, or in the case that disclosure is necessary in order to 
avoid severe harm up to the patient or others.121 The determination of whether such 
breach is legitimate is complex and will typically involve several decision-makers. 122
A survey study of Chilean nationals supported the conclusion that 70 percent 
of healthcare professionals and 77 percent of laypersons believed that the 
following factors were relevant to breaking confidentiality in the event a 
husband might transmit a serious sexually transmitted disease to his wife: (a) 
the patient’s intention to adopt protective behavior, (b) the patient’s intention 
to inform the spouse, (c) the severity of the risk (i.e., of the consequences of 
acquiring the disease), (d) the physician’s consultation with an expert, and (e) the 
time taken to discuss the severity of the disease with the patient. Data from a 
recent survey study supported the finding that most Chilean physicians believe 
that breaching patient confidentiality may be acceptable in some cases, a view 
that is consistent with the official position of the Chilean ethical code (and the 
ethical codes of nations such as the United States and the United Kingdom).123
Due to their broad application to data contained in and related to patient 
records, the confidentiality and related obligations of ROHSL and CEMAC would 
extend to mHealth and related data so long as such data relates to an actual 
patient record or other information covered by ROHSL and CEMAC.
In addition to the restrictions that apply specifically to health and medical data, 
Chile has enacted an omnibus data privacy law, the protections of which apply 
to all personally identifiable data, including health data. The data protection 
law imposes requirements to provide notice to individuals and in certain 
circumstances obtain their consent regarding the use and disclosure of their 
personal data as well as requirements regarding providing adequate security to 
personal data and the like. In addition and as discussed above, this data privacy 
law provides special protections to “sensitive personal data”, which includes 
health and medical data. Such special restrictions impose consent requirements 
on the collection, processing, and disclosure of such sensitive data. There are no 
provisions in the data privacy law that set special protection for women, minors

and spouses, or family members. However, on January 11, 2012, a bill, which has 
not yet been enacted, was entered by the Chilean Congress to update the data 
privacy law to ban the use of private/sensitive data of children except for data 
indispensable for identification purposes or in the case of a medical emergency 
(which would still require parental consent). 
Courts can order the correction, blockage, or deletion of data from the database 
and impose a fine for violations of the data privacy law. Violations are also 
subject to civil claims for damages.
iNDiA
In India, there is no specific law governing health and medical data (i.e., an 
omnibus health data law similar to HIPAA in the United States). 
Nevertheless, protection for health and medical data (which would encompass 
mHealth data) is provided by the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, 
Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 (“MCI Code”). The MCI Code applies to 
Registered Medical Practitioners in India (registered with various state medical 
councils as a precondition to practice medicine) and requires physicians to 
refrain from disclosing any “secrets of patients” that have been learned in the 
exercise of the physician’s profession (subject to certain limited exceptions, 
such as where required by applicable law and/or where necessary to prevent 
the spread of communicable diseases). In addition to general health data, 
there are two types of confidential information that a physician is prohibited 
from disclosing: (1) information concerning individual or domestic life of patient 
observed during medical attendance; and (2) information concerning defects in 
the disposition or character of patients observed during medical attendance. In 
case a medical practitioner is found to have failed to observe any of the duties 
prescribed in the MCI, such violation is considered to be an act of professional 
misconduct and the practicioner can be subject to a penalty ranging from 
temporary suspension to permanent disqualification from the practice of 
medicine. This penalty is in addition to any other criminal or civil liability that 
may be incurred for disclosure of patient information.
In addition, India has also enacted the Information Technology Act, 2000 
(the “ITA”) and Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and 
Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information)  Rules, 2011 (“Data 
Privacy Rules”). Although the ITA and the related Data Privacy Rules are not 
directed specifically at health and medical data, the majority of their protections, 
particularly the consent and disclosure requirements, apply to “sensitive 
personal data” as defined by the Data Privacy Rules. The definition of sensitive 
personal data expressly includes physical, physiological, and mental health 
 78 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
condition, sexual orientation, and medical records and history. The ITA and the 
Data Privacy Rules also impose significant information security requirements 
on individuals and entities that hold sensitive personal data and require such 
entities to develop and post (generally on a company website) a comprehensive 
privacy policy and to appoint a grievance officer. All such requirements 
would apply to mHealth data (so long as it meets the definition of sensitive 
data). Violations of the ITA and Data Privacy Rules are subject to fines and 
imprisonment as well as civil claims for damages. 
The Mental Health Act, 1987, permits governmentally authorized officers to 
inspect psychiatric hospitals, to demand records, and to interview patients. 
Indian case law recognizes the right of clinicians to disclose patients’ HIV status 
to their would-be partners (i.e., a fiancé) on the basis that the public interest 
prevails over the duty of confidentiality owed by a physician to a patient.124
From a cultural perspective, India has a very close-knit family system. Many 
households comprise both immediate and extended family members. Any 
sensitive personal data received from family members would also be protected 
by the ITA and the Data Privacy Rules.
A patient in India has a general right of privacy under the 2002 Medical 
Council of India Code of Ethics Regulations; however, confidentiality may be 
breached where required by law or if necessary to ensure public safety (e.g., for 
prevention of crime or disorder, for protection of health or morals, for protection 
of rights and freedom of others, for purposes of registering certain diseases, for 
investigating communicable diseases, or for reporting adverse drug events).125 In 
addition, patients must obtain a disability certificate in order to access benefits 
under the nation’s disabilities act, which could jeopardize health information 
privacy by placing it in the government’s control – particularly for those with 
psychiatric conditions.126

There is currently no law in Nigeria specifically related to the regulation of 
mHealth data. However, the national medical ethics code contains specific 
obligations related to the provision of mHealth services.

The Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria has issued a Code of Medical Ethics 
(the “Code”) pursuant to a mandate set forth in Nigeria’s Medical and Dental 
Practitioners’ Act (Cap. M8, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004), which 
establishes protections for medical and health data. The Code applies to all 
medical and dental practitioners and provides that all communications between 
a patient and a medical or dental practitioner made in the course of treatment 
are confidential and cannot be disclosed unless compelled by law. Medical 
and dental practitioners may disclose such communications upon receiving 
informed, express consent from the patient. The consent must be in writing. The 
Code provides that next of kin should give consent for patients who are minors, 
are unconscious or who have a mental impairment. Failure to obtain consent 
is deemed to constitute professional negligence on the part of a practitioner, 
who has a duty of care to each patient under the Code. In addition, the Code 
requires that practitioners clearly inform patients of the benefits and risks of any 
procedure.
NiGERiA’S ETHiCS CODE HAS PROviSiONS SPECiFiC TO mHEALTH
The Code contains particular provisions related to telemedicine, 
requiring that practitioners make appropriate arrangements to 
maintain the security of patient personal information when that 
information is stored, sent or received by fax, computer, email, or other 
electronic means.
The Code contains particular provisions related to telemedicine, requiring 
that practitioners make appropriate arrangements to maintain the security of 
patient personal information when that information is stored, sent, or received 
by fax, computer, email, or other electronic means. These provisions would be 
particularly applicable to mHealth. Where a practitioner fails to abide by the 
obligations for patient privacy and confidentiality, the practitioner faces penalties.
In addition to the obligation to obtain patient consent for disclosure of 
communications between patient and practitioner, Sections 37, 45 and 46 of 
the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (the “Constitution”) establish 
a general right of privacy for Nigerian citizens. This right of privacy under the 
Constitution covers individual correspondence, and telephonic and telegraphic 
communications. Therefore, collection and disclosure of an individual’s personal 
information, including health information, may constitute a violation of the 
Constitutional right of privacy, unless the individual has provided express 
consent. Pursuant to this constitutional right of privacy, an mHealth service 
provider would be obligated to obtain consent for the collection and transfer of 
individual data. Individuals whose privacy rights have been violated may bring a 
claim for enforcement in the state or federal high court.
 80 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
PERU
There is currently no law in Peru related specifically to the regulation of 
mHealth or related data. Peru has, however, enacted Law No. 26842, General 
Health Law (“GHL”). 
Subject to certain limited exceptions, GHL prohibits the release of information 
regarding a medical act (information related to the actions taken by the doctor 
and revealed by the patient for the purposes of treatment) without written 
consent. Doctors are also obligated to provide a copy of medical records to 
patients upon request, and GHL requires that medical records be subject to 
appropriate security and confidentiality controls. GHL also establishes that 
disabled people, children, teenagers, mothers, and elderly people who have 
been abandoned must receive priority attention.
A health professional, technician, or assistant who provides or discloses, by any 
means, information related to a medical act in which he or she participates or of 
which he or she has knowledge can incur civil or criminal liability, as appropriate, 
without prejudice to the sanctions that may be imposed by ethical codes. The 
following administrative penalties may also be imposed: admonition, fine, or 
temporary or permanent closure of the healthcare facility.
Peru has also implemented the Ethics and Deontology Code of the Peruvian 
College of Physicians, which establishes confidentiality requirements for patient 
data. Physicians found to violate this Code may be subject to the following 
sanctions: (1) note of reprobation; (2) private admonition; (3) fine; (4) public 
admonition; (5) suspension from practicing medicine for a maximum of two 
years; and (6) expulsion from the medical college.
Due to their broad application to data contained in and related to patient records, 
the confidentiality and related obligations of GHL and the code of ethics would 
extend to mHealth and related data (so long as such data relates to an actual 
patient record or other information covered by GHL and the code of ethics). 
In addition to the restrictions that apply specifically to health and medical data, 
Peru has enacted Law No. 29733, Personal Data Protection Law, an omnibus 
data privacy law, protections of which apply to all personally identifiable 
data, including health data. The data protection law imposes requirements to 
provide notice to individuals and in certain circumstances obtain their consent 
regarding the use and disclosure of their personal data as well as requirements 
regarding providing adequate security to personal data and the like. In addition 
and as discussed above, this data privacy law provides special protections to 
“sensitive personal data”, which includes health and medical data. Such special 
restrictions impose consent requirements on the collection, processing, and 
disclosure of such sensitive data. Exceptions to the consent requirements with 
regard to health data apply under the law when collection and processing are 
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 81
necessary in a situation of risk, prevention, diagnosis, or medical or surgical 
treatment of the owner of the information, if such processing is carried out by a 
medical institution or by health professionals, complying with the professional 
secret, for public health reasons, or for the realization of epidemiologic or 
analogous studies.
Note also that regulations for the data protection law have not been enacted, 
but it is anticipated that such regulations will establish special treatment for the 
processing of personal data of children and teenagers.
Violations of the personal data law trigger monetary fines.
TANZANiA
Tanzania has no specific and comprehensive privacy legislation that applies to 
mHealth or otherwise.  In addition, Tanzania has not implemented specific laws 
that govern the use and disclosure of health and medical data in general (i.e., 
an omnibus health data law similar to HIPAA).  Tanzania has, however, enacted 
several laws intended to protect the confidentiality and security of certain types 
of information.  For example, the HIV & AIDS (Prevention and Control) Act of 
2008 applies specifically to prevention, treatment, care, support, and control of 
HIV and AIDS.  At a high level, this act prevents healthcare practitioners from 
disclosing (without patient consent) records and documents related to HIV and 
AIDS (e.g., test results).  
Similarly, the Human DNA Regulation Act of 2009 applies to Human DNA 
or genetic information of any person and generally sets out the requirements 
for the collection, disclosure, protection, transport, destruction, and related 
treatment of such DNA or genetic information. 
Both the HIV & AIDS (Prevention and Control) Act of 2008 and the Human 
DNA Regulation Act of 2009 are generally technology-neutral and would 
apply mHealth applications and activities to the extent they involve the relevant 
covered information (and the individuals covered by such acts).
Tanzania has also established the Guiding Principles on Medical Ethics and 
Human Rights in Tanzania (Code of Ethics of Medical Profession in Tanzania), 
which, among other provisions, contains confidentiality provisions for patient data.  
Apart from the laws and code of practice discussed above, there are other laws 
that relate to health information, such as the Medical Practitioner and Dentists 
Ordinance of 1959. However, most of the laws that deal with health information in 
Tanzania cover only to confidentiality of the data and not broader privacy concerns. 
 82 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
Outside the realm of protections for health data, the Electronic and Postal 
Communications Act, Act No. 3 of 2010, deals with confidentiality in electronic 
communications in Tanzania. This Act, which could apply to health data as well 
as other types of data, imposes the duty on electronic service providers to secure 
confidentiality of such communications. In addition, Article 16 of the United 
Republic of Tanzania Constitution of 1977 provides for a general right to privacy.
UGANDA
In Uganda, there is no specific data protection law or privacy law that directly 
applies to mHealth. In addition, Uganda has not implemented specific laws that 
govern the use and disclosure of health and medical data in general (i.e., an 
omnibus health data law similar to HIPAA). 
Uganda has established the National Guidelines For Research Involving Humans as 
Research Participants (2007) (the “Research Guidelines”), the protections of which 
apply to all research participants and related data collected from such participants. 
At a high level, the purpose of the Research Guidelines is to ensure that all research 
in which humans participate as research subjects is done ethically, mindful of injury 
to participants and to ensure that the research data collected is kept confidential. 
The privacy/confidentiality protections of the Research Guidelines are broadly 
worded to protect the privacy of participation during and after the research and the 
confidentiality of data collected during the research.
Ugandan law does recognize the right to privacy as a human right.127 Ethical 
and legal policies for the protection of health information are generally not well 
developed.128 Additionally, healthcare providers often struggle to balance a duty to 
notify partners at risk with a competing ethical obligation to protect the medical 
confidentiality, safety, and well-being of people who have HIV.129 Special protections 
are provided to certain groups, including children, mature and emancipated 
minors, street children, prisoners, the homeless, substance abusers, people with 
disabilities, armed forces personnel and pregnant women. The Uganda Ministry of 
Health has promulgated a National Health Services Laboratory Policy that requires 
laboratory staff to safeguard privacy and confidentiality.130

WORKING TOWARD 
AN mHEALTH PRIVACY 
LAW FRAMEWORK
We have now set forth a more informed context for addressing mHealth data 
privacy and security issues through the law by sketching out the forces and 
actors at play in the mHealth ecosystem, by identifying some of the competing 
interests at play and their interrelatedness, and by attuning the reader to the 
complexity of legislating data privacy and security regulations. We learned that 
any effort at legislative reform to address mHealth privacy and security concerns 
must first take stock of the cultural, technological and legal context at play and 
acknowledge the effect that these and other factors could have on mHealth 
privacy and security and the success of any new policies.
We have also outlined the current state of data privacy and security laws 
around the world in all of its diversity and breadth, from the sectoral approach 
in the United States to the omnibus approach in Europe and those that fall 
in between. We aimed to simplify that diversity for purposes of comparison 
and study by stripping the laws down to their common core elements: scope 
of coverage, notice and consent provisions, onward transfer restrictions, data 
security, retention, integrity and availability, and enforcement. Some of these 
national laws also impose registration requirements and the appointment 
of dedicated data protection officers within covered organizations, but these 
requirements are aimed at providing further oversight and not the essence 
of providing privacy assurances to individuals. As such, these types of legal 
restrictions were not covered in detail. We learned through this exercise that 
mHealth has not been specifically addressed in any national law but that many 
existing laws are sufficiently broad in their application so as to reach mHealth 
products and services that handle covered data (either through specific health 
privacy laws or omnibus privacy laws). These laws also provide examples to 
those countries that have yet to develop omnibus or specific health privacy laws. 
However, further analysis should be conducted into the effectiveness of these 
laws given their current scope and any areas for potential reform.
Next, we looked at various examples of medical ethical codes around the 
world for lessons that could be applied to the mHealth context and to better 
understand the baseline privacy protections already afforded to patients in 
certain parts of the world. In many ways, these ethical codes both inform and 
reflect the national concept of health privacy and could provide a roadmap to 
future mHealth policies and legislation.
 84 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
Finally, we reviewed country law summaries, developed in collaboration with 
local attorneys in Chile, Peru, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, India and Bangladesh 
to assess where privacy law stands in some of the countries with the most 
promising adoption of mHealth solutions and services. Among these countries 
only Peru and Chile have comprehensive data protection laws. India and 
Bangladesh have other laws that address data privacy and security in certain 
respects. And, neither Uganda, Tanzania nor Nigeria have specific privacy laws 
but do provide some baseline protections through their constitutions and/
or medical ethics codes. Further study should be conducted as to the rates of 
mHealth adoption in these countries and any correlation with the degree of 
privacy regulation to better understand how the law can help more users take 
advantage of mHealth’s benefits.
Aided with this information, we can now begin shaping a framework to guide 
the mHealth community as it addresses privacy and security concerns in the 
effort to bring mHealth to scale. For this purpose we will use the core shared 
principles present in existing privacy laws and set forth some key guidelines 
and considerations to take into account when deciding where to draw the line 
under each category.

FACT GATHERiNG AND ANALYSiS
Given the complexity, multiplicity of actors and highly culture-specific 
dimension of privacy, consideration of mHealth privacy and security law issues 
should begin with a robust fact-finding exercise. This step should engage 
key stakeholders from the mHealth ecosystem (see Figure 4, above) and 
take into account the national legal framework, sophistication of institutions, 
technological infrastructure, enforcement resources and general culture of 
respect for the law. Unique vulnerabilities should be noted (such as entrenched 
norm of discussing patient information among healthcare staff outside of 
delivery of care context, which was identified in discussions with country health 
ministry representatives at the start of this project) and highlighted. Existing 
constitutional, ethical and industry-developed privacy protections should be 
identified so as to provide a baseline from which reform can begin to take shape. 
Finally, the particular mHealth uses in operation and likely to be implemented 
should be taken into account. 
The result would be a high-level map of the data flows related to mHealth in a 
particular jurisdiction, the likely data recipients (and their location), those who 
would seek access to the information (and their location) and the places where 
the privacy and security of such information may be especially vulnerable. 
Enforcement capabilities and resources would be identified and mapped to the 
greatest identified vulnerabilities. An earnest understanding of current local 
technological infrastructure would be kept front and center during the entire 
discussion. Only after completing this exercise, should a review of model laws 
and approaches be undertaken and the business of considering new laws begin. 
Otherwise, policymakers may risk adopting foreign approaches that are not 
compatible with local capabilities and contexts.
DETERMiNiNG SCOPE OF COvERAGE
Taking into account the results of the fact-gathering exercise, policymakers 
should consider the reach of the new laws. How will jurisdiction be exercised? 
What party in the mHealth supply chain will have primary responsibility for 
ensuring compliance with privacy and security regulations? Will they be explicitly 
required to demand the same level of accountability from their own providers 
and affiliates? Where is this burden most efficiently placed? Where is it most 
likely to produce a compliant culture? What explicit exceptions should be made?
From the examples of current legislation we have reviewed, most place 
responsibility at the first point of data collection. This has many benefits, most 
important of which is the closest relationship between the data subject and 
the data collector. This proximity could facilitate better privacy disclosures, 
 86 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
better understanding of the data subject’s privacy expectations and greater 
accountability from a market perspective (the primary service provider is more 
likely to hear of a complaint than a distant subcontractor). However, many 
existing laws have found the need to extend at least a subset of privacy and 
security regulations to other participants in the supply chain. Examples include 
HIPAA, which was amended to require covered organizations to extend by 
contract certain HIPAA obligations to service providers that could have access to 
covered data and to bring such entities into HIPAA’s jurisdiction for purposes of 
enforcement. More recent revisions added two new categories of covered entities, 
Health Information Organizations (which provide data transmission services for 
covered data) and Personal Health Record Vendors (which provide individuals 
with a data storage solution for their personal health records). Several U.S. states 
also have required that data security standards be contractually-mandated 
down the data management supply chain. These legislative changes reflect a 
change in the health information business models in existence and new ways of 
transmitting and storing covered data. They are also a response to new perceived 
vulnerabilities in the eHealth ecosystem. These are the types of considerations 
that should inform continued reform in this area.
In sum, the following are some of the key issues that should be addressed when 
determining scope of coverage:
— Jurisdictional reach (persons/entities with a local presence or also those 
who store or process data of residents but have no local presence)
— Persons/entities obligated to comply (primary data collectors or also other 
service providers who may have access and/or provide data storage and 
processing functions)
— Definition of “Personal Information” (any information that can be linked 
to an individual or more discrete categories of data, such as health 
information, that deserves special protection)
— Exceptions (for use of aggregated data for public health purposes, 
biomedical research, national emergencies, etc.).
NOTiCE AND CONSENT (CHOiCE)
For individuals to have the practical ability to exercise control over the collection, 
recording, access, and dissemination of their mHealth Data, they must be 
adequately informed about these practices and provided a choice. Current 
legislation addresses this core principle through disclosure and consent 
requirements. Most jurisdictions with specific health privacy or comprehensive 
privacy legislation require affirmative opt-in consent prior to the collection or 
use of sensitive categories of data, such as personal health information, for 
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 87
uses other than delivery of care, healthcare operations, payment and research 
based on de-identified data. For other types of information, such as name and 
contact details, some jurisdictions require only notice and opportunity to object, 
also referred to as tacit consent. A minority of jurisdictions require affirmative 
consent prior to collection of any type of personal information. 
When it comes to required disclosures, most jurisdictions provide a 
representative list of the types of information that must be included in an 
effective privacy notice but do not prescribe specific disclosure language and 
leaves that to the disclosing entity. This can be beneficial because it is likely 
to lead to more tailored disclosures that are more specific to the particular 
service and data usage than a boilerplate disclosure. Some laws provide only 
a standard that disclosing entities must meet, such as clear and accurate 
(the FTC Act in the United States, as applied to privacy disclosures), which is 
usually applied to more generic collections of information rather than sensitive 
information, such as personal health information. 
Given the options outlined above, determinations as to the type of notice and 
consent requirements should involve consideration of:
— Whether all personal information will be treated the same or whether 
certain categories of sensitive personal information will trigger greater 
compliance obligations
— Whether to require affirmative opt-in consent for changes in the usage of 
personal information collected (from its original disclosed purpose)
— Benefit of requiring a comprehensive list of disclosure categories against 
the transactional cost to individuals of reading and processing such 
disclosures for every type of personal information collection
— Feasibility of obtaining affirmative consent via electronic processes, 
potentially requiring corollary changes to laws of evidence making 
electronic consents admissible in court (to prove that an individual 
indeed consented to the described privacy practices). Where affirmative 
consent is required, covered entities should be provided with clear and 
practical methods for obtaining such consent. Uncertainty in this area 
may discourage compliance or even entrance into certain markets with 
particularly cumbersome or arcane requirements
— What degree of notification is required to provide individuals with the ability 
to exercise informed consents vs. encouraging covered entities to provide 
a laundry-list of potential uses (to over-comply where the line is unclear). 
Over-disclosure runs the risk of confusing the individual and may cover 
remote risks that trigger trepidation rather than trust
— For populations with significant rates of illiteracy, what alternatives can be 
employed to ensure effective communication of the disclosures and ability 
to evidence consent so that legal notice and consent requirements do not 
create a barrier to providing services to these populations
 88 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
— Whether a simplified approach to notice and consent should be adopted 
whereby only secondary purposes (i.e. purposes other than treatment, 
payment, healthcare operations, and de-identified research) would trigger 
notice and consent obligations.
DATA MiNiMiZATiON
The rise of electronic communication has correlated with an explosion in the 
amount of data that is created, and increasing computing power has allowed 
for much more of that data to be stored. Despite this, privacy law continues to 
champion the concept of data minimization and with good reason. The more 
data that is collected and stored, the more risk that is created (no matter the 
practices and standards built around collection and storage). Further, broad 
collections of personal information also make it more challenging for individuals 
to keep tabs on the uses and disclosures of such information, compromising 
their ability to exercise control over how their personal information is handled. 
Data minimization (sometimes also referred to as “Privacy by Design” or 
“Purposeful Data Collection”) refers to the reduction of irrelevant data collections, 
uses, and transmissions. Just because an mHealth application may provide a 
cheap and easy way to gather and organize enormous amounts of personal 
information, this does not necessarily mean that it should be done. There should 
be a defined purpose for each collection of personal information, especially in the 
case of sensitive information such as personal health information. 
Most laws do not address this issue head-on but attempt to encourage data 
minimization by requiring covered entities to use personal information only for 
the purposes collected and appropriately disclosed. The obligation to account 
for all personal information in this manner naturally drives covered entities to 
limit the amount of data collected (and, thus, reduce their compliance burden 
and regulatory exposure). 
However, this principle should be weighed against the potential benefits of “big 
data” especially in the healthcare field. There are countless initiatives around 
the data-driven healthcare movement, which promises, among other things, to 
create more tailored and effective treatment by leveraging large data stores to 
more accurately predict outcomes and determine successful treatment avenues.1 
Some proponents say that the additional value of big data is that it could lead to 
discoveries and innovations that no one has currently envisioned or set out to find. 
1 See, e.g., McKinsey & Co., The ‘big data’ revolution in healthcare: Accelerating value and innovation (Jan. 2013).
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 89
This is precisely why limiting the uses of data for privacy purposes could curtail 
the effectiveness of certain big data projects in the healthcare field. It is not 
always clear at the outset which data sets will prove important. For this reason, 
it may be appropriate to create exceptions in the privacy laws for valid research 
purposes (perhaps with a clear application and approval structure administered 
by a public health authority) and for the use of anonymized or aggregated 
data. Of course, individuals are always free to participate in such initiatives and 
provide their data voluntarily. However, it may still make sense to bind these 
entities to comply with specific data security obligations even if the notice and 
consent requirements may be relaxed for these limited purposes.
DATA iNTEGRiTY AND ACCESSiBiLiTY
Any personal information collected should be accurate and should remain 
accessible to the data subject for the purposes of updating and correcting. When 
personal information is stored out of the data subjects’ reach, the risks associated 
with errors in their records are compounded, particularly in the healthcare 
context. Payors and providers are likely to rely on these records to make decisions 
about treatment and payment of services, so that errors could have a substantial 
impact on the data subject. This principle also is key for securing the individual’s 
ability to exercise control over the collection, recording, access, and dissemination 
of their mHealth Data. Access and the ability to correct records is instrumental to 
the concept of control. 
Most laws, therefore, require covered entities to provide data subjects with 
access to their personal information in some shape or form, especially sensitive 
information such as personal health information. Some require covered entities 
to provide data subjects with an accounting of all personal information stored 
(the more personal information that is regulated / the broader the definition 
of personal information, the more burdensome this requirement), while others 
require transmission or access to a copy of that subject’s personal record. 
Complying with such obligations requires covered entities to implement special 
data collection and organization controls and to make structural changes that 
allow the personal information of one data subject to be accessed without 
accessing the personal information of others. Therefore, these types of 
provisions are difficult to enact with retroactive or immediate effect. The cost of 
compliance should be considered carefully along with limitations on vexatious 
or abusive requests by data subjects. Most legislation allows covered entities 
to take “commercially reasonable” measures to respond to such requests and 
allow a reasonable time to respond.
 90 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
Legislation with respect to data access and correction should also take into 
account the following issues:
— If someone has healthcare power of attorney for an individual, can they 
obtain access to that individual’s medical record
— Can the personal representative of an adult or emancipated minor obtain 
access to that individual’s medical record
— How can family members of a deceased individual obtain the deceased 
individual’s personal health information that is relevant to their own 
healthcare
— Do parents have the right to see their children’s medical records
— If a child receives emergency medical care without a parent’s consent, can 
the parent obtain all information about the child’s treatment and condition
— Will this access and correction obligation be extended beyond the primary 
data collector? Will it apply to research uses as well
— Will individuals have access to their records at no cost
Maintaining the accuracy and integrity of personal information stored is also 
crucial and depends on sufficient internal controls to keep the data secure. This 
principle is discussed in the next section.
DATA SECURiTY
Data security is non-controversial in that most jurisdictions agree that it is 
essential to a privacy law system, especially in the digital, globalized age. 
However, they have approached the issue quite differently. The United States 
is one of the legislative leaders in this area, with some of the broadest, most 
detailed and most punitive data security laws on the books. Under U.S. law, 
data breaches trigger significant notification obligations and could lead to 
considerable fines. As noted above, data security obligations are more likely 
to be regulated all the way through the data management supply chain than 
privacy obligations.
On the opposite side of the token is Europe with very robust and exacting 
privacy laws but very few member states with any specific requirements as to 
data security or measures to be taken in case of a security breach. 
Policymakers considering legislation on data security should consider:
— In how much detail will data security be regulated? Where is delegation 
to industry standards appropriate? How can the law remain flexible and 
relevant with changing security threats and solutions
— Whether to include specific data retention provisions or require covered 
entities to simply keep data no longer than is necessary and employ secure 
disposal measures
    PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH 91
— Whether specific identity and age verification practices should be legislated 
across the board or just for particularly sensitive data (such as online 
collection of children’s data under the COPPA in the United States); if 
so, what practical verification options will be offered to covered entities? 
Uncertainty in this area can be especially frustrating and discouraging to 
covered entities
— Whether to institute data breach notification obligations on covered 
entities, their sub-contractors, those with a local presence or any that store 
residents’ data
DATA TRANSFERS TO THiRD PARTiES 
AND ACROSS BORDERS
Restrictions on the ability to transfer personal information from the original 
data collector to third parties and beyond the data subject’s home country aim 
to ensure that the privacy disclosures made and the protections offered at the 
point of collection hold throughout the lifecycle of the data collected. Especially 
in mHealth, a number of entities are likely to process, store or access a data 
subject’s personal information, and many of these entities may be located in 
multiple countries. To the extent that these entities are completely divorced from 
the privacy disclosures made to the data subject and the privacy protections 
offered and/or are outside of the jurisdiction of local privacy authorities, it 
may be difficult to ensure adequate controls over them and their handling of 
personal information.
The European approach to this challenge is to restrict all transfers of all 
types of personal information outside of Europe, identifying a select number 
of non-European jurisdictions as providing “adequate” privacy protections 
(Canada, Argentina, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Israel, Switzerland, and Uruguay). 
These jurisdictions are deemed adequate because they have privacy laws with 
substantially similar requirements to the European law. This legislative choice 
may be partly responsible for influencing a number of countries outside of 
Europe to adopt privacy laws based on the European model and more likely 
to be deemed “adequate” in the future. Any transfers outside of Europe or 
the adequate jurisdictions requires execution of model contractual clauses, 
prescribed by law and not subject to negotiation or modification or satisfaction 
of a few other limited statutory bases. The only tailored content is the name of 
the contracting entities, a description of the types of personal information being 
transferred and purposes for the transfer. Transfers to unaffiliated third parties 
within Europe must be accompanied by the execution of certain privacy and 
security terms to ensure that personal information is processed according to law 
and the privacy notice provided to the particular data subjects.
 92 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
In the United States, there is no restriction on cross-border transfers, but 
transfers of regulated personal information to third parties may require certain 
contractual privacy and security terms, such as under HIPAA for Business 
Associates. The U.S. state of Massachusetts, for example, also requires data 
security provisions to flow down through contract to all service providers with 
access to the personal information of Massachusetts residents (defined narrowly 
as a resident’s name along with a social security number, driver’s license number 
or financial account number with any necessary access codes). In addition, many 
U.S. states impose data breach notification obligations not only on the primary 
data collector but also on those entities that may store or process the data on 
behalf of such covered entities. These laws reflect a preference for imposing 
data security obligations more broadly than data privacy obligations. 
Other countries that restrict third-party and cross-border transfers specifically, 
like Europe, simply require some contractual vehicle for ensuring that adequate 
data protections flow down to all entities who may have access to the covered 
data but do not prescribe the precise contractual language.
Policymakers considering implementation of third-party and cross-border 
transfer restrictions should consider:
— Any effect such restrictions may have on new market entrants, especially 
start-ups or smaller companies that may not be able to establish a local 
presence and could derive efficiencies from processing the data remotely or 
through sub-contractors
— What are the least restrictive means available for ensuring that all parties 
with access to personal information of residents are bound by the privacy 
promises made at the time of collection?  Sometimes extending liability 
for the acts of all sub-contractors and agents on the primary collector can 
accomplish this goal
— What effect could such restrictions have on other sectors outside of 
mHealth (e.g., outsourcing sector, technology start-ups, cloud storage 
providers, etc.)
ENFORCEMENT AND SANCTiONS
Covered entities must be held accountable for complying with data privacy 
and security regulations, and remedies must exist to address security breaches 
and privacy violations. Current legislation takes vastly different approaches to 
this principle. Some provide for administrative fines only (and some are quite 
modest), while others provide for substantial fines and civil penalties. Punitive 
and exemplary damages are available in some jurisdictions where bad faith or 
willfulness can be demonstrated. Some regulatory authorities also retain the 
ability to impose sanctions on covered entities, imposing regular third-party 
audits and enhanced reporting requirements. 
Along with the consideration of what levels of fines and sanctions to impose, 
policymakers should also consider what enforcement resources are available to carry 
out and enforce the laws and ensure that violations are timely punished. A number 
of countries with privacy laws are still rarely enforcing them, which sends the wrong 
message to covered entities and to the citizens that the laws aim to protect.
 94 PATiENT PRivACY iN A MOBiLE WORLD – A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS PRivACY iSSUES iN MOBiLE HEALTH
CONCLUSION
In addition to the areas of further study noted above, 
the mHealth community should also consider what 
mechanisms to employ to promote enforcement and 
compliance with mHealth privacy and security standards 
(legal and beyond), including developing awareness 
training models and training and certification approaches 
for providers and other data recipients. This paper only 
begins to lay a foundation for further research and 
discussion to create viable privacy and data security 
solutions that continue to encourage the growth and 
success of mHealth.
