SOML & ICT4SOML
The Nigerian Government’s Saving One Million Lives (SOML) 
Initiative was launched to prevent the deaths of one million new 
and expectant mothers, newborns, and children under five by 
2015; and catalyze the improvement of the health of Nigerians 
  
ICT4SOML is the partnership between the SOML Programme 
Delivery Unit and development partners to support the FMOH 
and FMCT in accelerating efforts to improve health outcomes and 
strengthen the health system by leveraging increased access and 
use of mobile and related ICTs. 
In support of the government leadership and at their request, the 
Government of Norway engaged the UN Foundation in 
collaboration with other partners to identify early opportunities 
to scale health ICT platforms alongside a multi-stakeholder and 
sectorial effort to develop a National Health ICT Strategic 
Framework

TECHNOLOGY & HEALTHCARE
While technology is a great catalyst and enabler of 
improvements and efficiencies, its needs to be appropriately 
implemented and deployed.
ICT4SOML is putting in place the building blocks to enable 
Nigeria to leverage Information Communication Technologies 
(ICTs) to achieve Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 
(child and maternal health) through the development of a 
Health ICT Framework (eHealth strategy) for the country.
This enabling environment is essential to ensure the optimal, 
effective  and sustainable use of ICTs in healthcare delivery.

GUIDANCE FOR THE PROCESS
The development of the country’s 
Health ICT Framework is been 
guided by the guided by the WHO-
ITU National eHealth Strategy 
Toolkit.
The Toolkit is a resource for 
developing or renewing a country’s 
eHealth strategy, irrespective of the 
country’s level of eHealth 
investment and development

WHO-ITU National eHealth Strategy Toolkit
Part 2 Part 3
Part 1
National eHealth action National eHealth monitoring 
National eHealth Vision
plan & evaluation
The toolkit recommends a 3 - part approach to the development of 
an eHealth strategy.
So far we are engaging with stakeholders, gathering information on 
the eHealth landscape in the country and are in the process of 
defining a governance structure at the national level for eHealth
Our process - in Nigeria -  has completed Part 1 (Vision), is far gone 
into Part 2 (Action Plan) and started work on Part 3 (M&E plan).
We hope to have a completed draft of the entire framework by Q3 
2015
UPDATES
The FMoH & FMCT with support from strategic partners are 
working with strategic partners, to achieve this in several 
ways:
Assessments 
• Policy review, 
• landscape assessment & inventory of ICT implementations 
in health
• Field assessment to validate the inventory.
Workshops & meetings  these have 
• introduced the Health ICT Framework development process 
&  prioritized components for the framework, 
• articulated an eHealth vision statement and 
• Initiated the Action plan development
ACHEIVEMENTS: Direct
• Identification and coordination for early opportunities for 
scaling ICT within the health sector- including DHIS2, mCCT, 
Supply Chain strengthening & Demand generation thru MAMA 
Nigeria.
• Assessment of policies, applications and the use of ICTs within 
and by the health sector.
• The active engagement of over 190 stakeholders representing 
48 institutions, including NHIS, WHO MDCN, NITDA, NUC, NCC, 
USPF, Galaxy backbone, NIGCOMSAT, NIMC, NPHCDA in a 
multi-stakeholder, multi-sectorial collaborative and 
participatory process.
• A draft of the National Health ICT Strategic Framework and 
Action Plan to be finalized in early third quarter of 2015.
ACHEIVEMENTS: Indirect
• Increased knowledge, awareness and capacity within key 
government and non-government institutions in the 
application and use of ICT for health.
• Increased understanding, demand, and mainstreaming of 
technology by and within the health sector.
• Increased capacity of FMoH to assess and evaluate ICT 
investment opportunities in the light of current needs and 
preparedness.
• More effective engagements in health by ICT-related MDAs, 
including FMCT, NITDA, and others.
• Expansion of health ICT discussions and activities from 
    MDGs to UHC.
NEXT STEPS
• Stakeholder workshop for final review of Draft National 
Health ICT Strategic Framework
• Government and development partner dialogue on 
resource alignment and strategic planning for 
implementation
• Facilitation of approval and adoption by key government 
institutions 
• Socialization of health ICT outputs within and among 
government and developmental partners
• Engagement of implementation partners in developing 
institutional implementation plans to execute against 
planned activities
LESSONS LEARNT
• Process should be as collaborative as possible
• Political support from the Ministry of Health is critical
• Strengthen capacity with Government institutions
• The WHO-ITU National eHealth Strategy Toolkit is a guide, 
you may need to domesticate it
• Talk to & learn from other country experiences
Thank you

attention
