Our	mission	is	to	make	better	health	as	easy	as	starting	a	
conversation
engaging	users
Turning	marketing	campaigns	into	engagement	is	hard.	
Let	askNivi	do	the	hard	work	for	you.
The	process	is	simple.	Start	by	including	a	unique	keyword	or	promo	code	in	your	marketing	
campaigns.	When	a	user	texts	askNivi	for	free	via	SMS	(Facebook	and	WhatsApp	coming	soon),	
we’ll	automatically	identify	her	intent	and	route	her	to	the	best	conversation.	Conversations	can	kick	
out	to	live	customer	success	teams	at	any	point.	Don't	want	to	run	your	own	marketing	campaigns	or	
support	teams?	No	problem,	we	can	help.
delivering	for	partners
We	turn	data	into	insights	for	partners	in	industry,	
government,	and	the	non-profit	sectors
Our	custom	dashboards	connect	your	marketing	campaigns	to	user	engagement	with	askNivi	and	
follow-on	services	like	medical	referrals.	We	take	the	pain	out	of	reporting	and	analytics.	Let	us	work	
with	you	to	build	the	reporting	tools	that	help	you	make	real-time,	informed	decisions.	Give	our	
basic	demo	a	try	and	we'll	walk	you	through	the	next	steps.
