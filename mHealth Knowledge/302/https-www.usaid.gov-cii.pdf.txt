CENTER	FOR	INNOVATION	AND	IMPACT	(CII)
USAID's	CII	strives	to	create	new	and	better	ways	of	doing	business	and	generate	impact	by
harnessing	the	power	of	previously	untapped	innovative	minds	worldwide.
USAID's	Center	for	Innovation	and	Impact	(CII)	applies	business-minded	approaches	to	the
development,	introduction	and	scale-up	of	health	interventions	to	accelerate	impact	against	the
world's	most	important	health	challenges.
The	Center	–	which	resides	in	the	Global	Health	Bureau	–	invests	seed	capital	in	the	most	promising	ideas	and	applies	a	rigorous,	market-oriented
approach	to	cut	the	time	it	takes	to	transform	discoveries	in	the	lab	to	impact	on	the	ground.
What	we	do:
Catalyze	Innovation
The	Center	uses	a	variety	of	novel	approaches	–	from
Grand	Challenges	to	hackathons	to	prizes	–	to	source
groundbreaking	solutions	for	tough	and	seemingly
intractable	health	challenges.
Scale	for	Impact
The	Center	supports	introduction	and	scale-up
planning	for	priority	health	interventions;	uses
innovative	financing	mechanisms;	applies	market
shaping	tools	to	address	inefficiencies	and	barriers;
and	leverages	the	expertise	and	active	engagement
of	the	private	sector	–	all	to	accelerate	and	rapidly
expand	health	impact. [PDF,	12MB]
Strengthen	and	Apply	Cross-cutting	Enablers
To	help	improve	the	efficiency	of	the	marketplace,
the	Center	examines	successes	and	failures	across	a
range	of	markets	and	sectors	to	identify	state-of-the-
art	practices	in	innovation,	introduction,	and	uptake.
