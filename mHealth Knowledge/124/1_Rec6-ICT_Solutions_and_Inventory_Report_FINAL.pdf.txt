This report was created for the United Nations Commission on Life-saving Commodities for 
Women and Children under Recommendation 6 on Supply and Awareness that states that by 
2015, all Every Woman, Every Child countries have improved the supply of life-saving 
commodities and build on ICT best practices for making these improvements (United Nations 
Foundation, 2013).

Introduction 
 
For the United Nations Commission on Life-saving Commodities for Women and Children 
(hereafter referred to as “the Commission”), the ability of countries to predict, forecast, and 
manage the 13 essential commodities along their supply chains is critical to the success of saving 
the lives of the millions of women and children who die every year from preventable deaths. 
Additionally, optimizing in-country supply chains to reduce losses related to overstocking, 
waste, expiration dates, damaged commodities, and inefficiencies can protect program 
investments and strengthen health systems to better deliver health services to the women and 
children who need them the most.  
 
For areas around the world once inaccessible to health services, two recent trends provide new 
ways to rethink how supply chain capabilities, such as tracking and monitoring, can be 
improved.. First, there is a large variety of information and communication technologies (ICT) 
which are now available to support commodity management and improve the speed and visibility 
of data. Second, access to mobile and wireless connectivity is increasing globally. With these 
two trends reshaping the possibilities for improved management of health commodities, supply 
chain managers are shifting away from paper-based supply chain management systems and 
exploring appropriate-technology solutions to meet supply chain data management needs.   
 
The details included in this report serve to complement the inventory spreadsheet, which 
contains a catalog of ICT solutions for supply chains. The objective of the inventory is to assist 
countries in selecting a supply chain tool by reviewing the ways in which existing ICT solutions 
have been already implemented in different countries. The following sections describe how to 
use the inventory, resources on how to select an ICT tool or product, and ways forward.  
Using the Inventory 
 
The inventory lists ICT tools/products that were identified through a scoping exercise, which 
included a review of grey and white literature, interviews with individuals at institutions 
involved in developing and implementing ICT tools/products for supply chain management, and 
existing databases of tools/products.a Each column within the inventory is described below. It is 
important to mention that 27 other tools/products were identified but were not catalogued in the 
inventory because of lack of comprehensive information for the categories below.b Additionally, 
some of the same tools/products are implemented in different countries in different ways and 
under different local names, which is shown in the inventory. 
 Overall Purpose – For which domain in the supply chain is this tool/product relevant?  
Supply chain domains have been identified (See “Recommendation 6, Outcome 1: Good 
Practice in Supply Chain Management, Challenges and Barriers along the In-country 
Supply Chain” document). Figure 1 shows the different domains: regulatory policies and 
                                                        
a These databases included: USAID | DELIVER PROJECT’s Supply Chain Software Inventory (USAID | DELIVER PROJECT, 
Task Order 4, 2008); VillageReach and Dimagi, Inc.’s Lessons Learned: ICTs for Supply Chain Management in Low-Resource 
Settings (VillageReach & Dimagi, 2013); and WHO/AMDS’s PSM Toolbox (WHO AIDS Medicines and Diagnostics Service 
(AMDS), 2014).  
b These 27 ICT tools/products are listed at the bottom of the inventory.

procedures, quantification – forecasting and supply planning, procurement, warehousing 
and inventory management, distribution, service delivery and utilization, and supply 
chain monitoring. In the inventory, other related supply chain domains are also listed if 
applicable for a certain tool/product.

For further inquiries on each tool/product, a contact person or email is provided. 
 
Resources on how to select an ICT tool/product 
Identifying needs within different contexts and finding the appropriate solution 
 
Selecting an ICT tool or product requires identifying context-specific needs. Lessons learned 
from other programs that have leveraged ICT as a platform for managing supply chains suggest 
that implementers must first identify all end users of the system (VillageReach & Dimagi, 2013). 
With all the different types of end users in mind, implementers must decide on what is desired 
 3 
from the system in terms of data quality, the number of data points of interest, how frequently 
data must be entered, initial and ongoing training sessions, and data collection issues.  The 
implementers must also think through these aspects in the context of existing and/or paper-based 
information and communication channels along the supply chain. Additional resources for 
deciding how to apply ICT for supply chain management include:

Ways Forward 
 
The success of using ICTs for supply chain management relies on the effectiveness of the 
procedures and processes that support the supply chains for essential commodities. Similarly, the 
integration of ICTs can exacerbate existing gaps in the supply of commodities. To provide a 
framework for this, John Snow, Inc. (JSI) has described the common evolution with three 
sequential phases towards achieving an integrated public health supply chain (John Snow Inc., 
2012):  
 Ad hoc phase – describes countries that have no formal procedures for the operation of a 
supply chain 
 Organized phase – describes countries that have implemented standardized supply chains 
that run on basic and established roles and procedures 
 Integrated phase – describes countries that have supply chains running with involved 
people, functions, levels, and entities that collaborate and trust each other 
 
 4 
Often before arriving at the integrated phase, countries will have several independent systems of 
varying complexities in place. This approach without overlap can be redundant and inefficient, 
since different systems are likely to capture similar information. Effective strategies to move 
parallel systems towards integrated systems include encouraging collaboration and cooperation 
amongst the various implementing partners. As was done in Ethiopia, recognizing the need and 
establishing ways for integration can occur in workshops followed by the creation of data 
protocols (Hawkins, Gebre-Mariam, & Lassooy, 2009). In their report, JSI further describes how 
to move from the ad hoc phase to the organized phase, as well as move from the organized phase 
to the integrated phase (John Snow Inc., 2012). 
 Moving from ad hoc to organized –  
o Assess current system using process mapping, network optimization, and costing 
analysis 
o Undertake technology assessments to improve information for decision making 
o Employ system design process for all logistics functions and products using 
segmentation analysis 
o Roll out system, including logistics training and dissemination of job descriptions, 
standard operating procedures, and supervision guidelines 
o Perform regular quantification of commodities 
 Moving from organized to integrated –  
o Create a logistics management unit and establish central level technical groups 
and committees 
o Professionalize supply chain managers 
o Optimize performance with analysis and design tools 
o Introduce flexible schedules and sources 
o Strengthen automated processes for data aggregation, analysis, and sharing 
o Generate and publish routine logistics reports 
o Develop performance-based management plans with indicators and incentives 
 
VillageReach and Dimagi, Inc. have developed a set of recommendations for migrating supply 
chain management programs from paper-based to ICT enhanced systems. Two such 
considerations are to establish core functionalities ahead of scale-up and consider the 
sophistication (or breadth of applicability) of the tool (VillageReach & Dimagi, 2013). Extra 
efforts related to initial supervision, training, capacity building, and feedback loops are needed to 
coordinate the workflow changes.

- Quantimed provides forecasting and cost estimations by facilitating calculation of 
pharmaceutical needs (e.g. Volume of medicine and medical supply items and 
costs) for general health services or specific health programs at central, regional, 
and district levels.
- Users may employ one or more quantification methods - past consumption, 
morbidity (including scaling up patterns), and proxy consumption - in response to 
expertise and available data. The tool is designed to improve the accuracy of order 
planning and budgeting by providing a systematic approach to organizing and 
analyzing data.
- Quantimed facilitates the calculation of commodity needs using either a single 
method or a combination of any of the three primary quantification methods: past 
consumption, morbidity patterns, and proxy consumption.
