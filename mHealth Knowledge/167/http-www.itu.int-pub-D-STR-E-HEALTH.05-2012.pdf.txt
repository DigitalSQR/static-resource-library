health-care	services	is	rapidly	expanding	and	increasingly	important.	This	is	especially	so	at	a Publication	Catalogue
time	when	all	health	systems	face	stringent	economic	challenges	and	greater	demands	to
provide	more	and	better	care,	especially	to	those	most	in	need.	The	National	eHealth	Strategy Accessible	publications
Toolkit	is	an	expert,	practical	guide	that	provides	governments,	their	ministries	and	stakeholders
with	a	solid	foundation	and	method	for	the	development	and	implementation	of	a	national
eHealth	vision,	action	plan	and	monitoring	framework.	All	countries,	whatever	their	level	of
development,	can	adapt	the	Toolkit	to	suit	their	own	circumstances.	Representing	one	of	the PUBLICATIONS	BY	SECTOR
most	significant	collaborations	in	recent	years	between	the	World	Health	Organization	and	the
International	Telecommunication	Union,	the	Toolkit	is	a	landmark	in	understanding	what	eHealth General	Secretariat	and	ITU	Telecom
is,	what	it	can	do,	and	why	and	how	it	should	be	applied	to	health	care	today.
