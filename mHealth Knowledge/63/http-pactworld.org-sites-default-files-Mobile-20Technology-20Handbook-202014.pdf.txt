Foreword 
 
 
Mobile technology may be poised to change the field of development, especially monitoring 
and evaluation. Every month, cellular voice and data networks reach farther into developing 
countries; increasingly, international nongovernmental organizations are using mobile 
technology in their programming. There were more than 6 billion mobile phone subscribers in 
2012, according to the World Bank,1 and a billion mobile broadband subscribers in 2011, 
according to the International Telecommunications Union2; 75% of the world has access to a 
mobile phone. The ubiquity of mobile phones is well illustrated in a 2013 quote from the 
United Nations News Center: “Of the world’s 7 billion people, 6 billion have mobile phones. 
However, only 4.5 billion have access to toilets or latrines.”3  
This handbook is intended to give people involved in international development work a 
framework for getting started with mobile technology. It is meant to be paired with training 
slides that provide more examples and context.  It was created using training resources 
developed by myself and by Alison Koler, Jade Lamb, Joris Vandelanotte, and Reid Porter. 
Other contributors include Tim Michetti, Charles Guedenet, Daisy Kisyombe, Olufemi 
Akinmade, and Samuel Kuhlande. 
We hope that the work reflected in these pages will help you use technology to make your work 
as development practitioners more innovative and efficient.

Glossary  
 
 
Although many of the following terms will be discussed in detail in the coming chapters, it is 
helpful to begin to familiarize yourself with common mobile technology terms and concepts.   
Airtime:  The time spent talking or otherwise using the voice function of a mobile device; 
mobile carriers determine billing charges based on the airtime used.  
Android: Popular operating system developed by Google that is used on many smartphones 
and tablets. Android’s main competition in the smartphone market is Apple’s iOS used on 
iPhones and iPads. 
App: A small, specialized piece of software that can be downloaded onto a mobile device. 
“App” is short for “application.” 
Basic phone: Device with basic phone functionality (e.g., SMS and voice), very limited 
computing power, few connectivity options, and a basic user interface and numeric keypad. 
Crowdsourcing: Obtaining information or input into a particular task or project by enlisting 
the services of a number of people, either paid or unpaid, typically via the Internet. 
Graphical user interface (GUI): The screen that a user interacts with to operate a mobile 
device. Basic phones and some feature phones are display only. Other feature phones, 
smartphones, and tablets use larger touch screens for richer interaction and usability. 
Feature phone: Midrange mobile device with a graphical user interface, basic apps, and 
more numerous connectivity options than a basic phone, but without a smartphone’s 
computing power and QWERTY keyboard. 
GIS: Geographic information system. A platform designed to capture, edit, analyze, and 
visualize geographic or spatial data, usually via a map. 
GPRS: General packet radio service. A data transmission system similar to SMS but without 
limits on the number of characters or transmission size. 
GPS: Global positioning system. A network of satellites that broadcast signals read by 
handheld GPS units or other GPS-enabled mobile devices to calculate a precise location using 
latitude and longitude coordinates. 
GSM: Global system for mobiles. The most widely used cellphone technology globally.  GSM-
compliant phones have removable SIM cards, which enable you to transfer your mobile 
subscription account, contacts, and other data from one GSM phone to another. 
7 
ICT4D: Information communication and technology for development. The use of mobile and 
computing devices to improve development outcomes. 
IMEI: International mobile equipment identity. The unique identification number found 
printed inside the battery compartment or listed under a device’s settings menu.   
Java: Popular operating system for a feature phone and some smartphones. 
Mobile platform: The system that receives the data sent from mobile devices. The various 
mobile platforms have varied features and functions, including data storage, data verification, 
data analysis, and data reporting.  
QWERTY:  The standard layout of an English keyboard, with the letters q, w, e, r, t, and y 
positioned in that order, reading from left to right, on the top row of alphabetic characters.   
SIM card: Subscriber identity module. A small card inserted into a mobile device on which 
phone numbers, contact information, and other data are stored.  
Skip logic: Instructions programmed into a mobile-based questionnaire that will present a 
different series of questions to the user based on a previous response. Also known as 
conditional branching. 
Smartphone: High-end, full-featured mobile device with touchscreen graphical user 
interface, on-screen or hard-button QWERTY keypad, advanced computing power, 
downloadable apps, GPS receiver, and multiple connectivity options.  
SMS: Short message service. System for sending short messages of a fixed length—
traditionally a maximum of 160 characters in English, with other lengths in other languages. 
Tablet: Full-featured mobile device with large touchscreen graphical user interface, on-screen 
keyboard, advanced computing power, downloadable apps, GPS receiver, and multiple 
connectivity options. Tablets typically lack SMS and voice communication options.

Introduction 
 
 
Mobile technology has already proven itself a powerful and efficient tool that accelerates 
achievement of project objectives and ultimately of development goals.  
Efficiency and data quality gains have been accepted as the norm for many applications, and 
the frontier of possibilities expands daily.  
Given the dynamic and evolving nature of the mobile technology field, the following chapters 
are not exhaustive and do not aspire to be. But whether you are a practitioner in the field or a 
project manager at headquarters, you will learn in these pages how to begin developing and 
putting in place a mobile technology strategy for development programming and how to select 
mobile platforms; case studies will show you how mobile technology has been used for 
development. You can use the handbook simply as a reference or make it the foundation for a 
workshop to spread learning throughout a team.  
How to Use This Handbook 
Start your process by reviewing literature on how mobile technology has been implemented in 
your specific technical field and/or country.  Combining such contextual information with the 
overview of mobile technology provided here will support creative problem solving, stimulate 
project design, and help you begin to stay current on developments in this dynamic field.   
Look for resources for continued learning throughout the handbook.

Chapter 1 
Understanding Mobile Technology  
and Its Applications 
 
 
CHAPTER LEARNING GOALS 
 Understand information communication technology for development (ICT4D), 
including mobile technology—what it is and what it can do.  
 Discuss the advantages of mobile data collection over traditional methods of 
collecting data. 
 Learn how mobile technologies are being used in international development. 
 
 
What Is Information Communication Technology for Development? 
ICT4D is the application of common, everyday technologies to development.  This handbook 
focuses on the mobile technology (specifically, on phones and tablets) and how they are being 
used around the world to accelerate development goals.  Projects from diverse technical areas 
have adopted mobile technology to perform: 
 Survey data collection 
 Routine M&E 
 Dissemination of general or targeted information 
 Awareness and sensitization campaigns 
 Patient tracking 
 Surveillance and reporting 
 Crowdsourcing 
 Logistics management information systems 
 Mobile banking and cash transfers 
 Coordinating service delivery or referral services 
 Conflict early warning systems 
 Public dialogue  
 
Refer to Appendix 1 to see how Pact has implemented mobile technology in its programming.

What Are the Advantages of Mobile Data Technology? 
The advantages of using mobile data technology over traditional, paper-based methods 
include: 
 Faster, more accessible data—Data collected in the field with mobile devices can be 
submitted and stored online or on home office servers, allowing for real-time access to data 
for analysis and decision making. 
 More reliable data—Collecting data in the field with mobile devices eliminates the need 
to enter data from paper into a database, therefore reducing the opportunity for error or 
loss. 
 Cleaner data—Mobile applications embed skip logic that directs respondents to specific 
sections of the questionnaire based on previous responses (e.g., different questions for 
males and females).  Thus, data is never entered where it doesn’t belong.   
 Ability to monitor data collection—By monitoring GPS locations and time stamps of 
submitted surveys, you can track field worker performance and the quality of incoming data.  
 Richer data—Integrated GPS coordinate collection, camera capabilities, and audio capture 
broaden the scope and type of information that may be collected.  
 Built-in data visualization—In some systems, online interfaces permit data visualization 
or have dashboards that allow data to be manipulated, customized, and downloaded.  
 More than just data—Mobile devices support a range of capabilities beyond data 
collection (e.g., mobile banking, patient tracking, and crowdsourcing, as well as 
communication).

Chapter 2 
Developing a Strategy and Getting Started 
 
 
CHAPTER LEARNING GOALS 
 Develop your own mobile technology strategy document. 
 Brainstorm ways in which mobile technology can improve a project. 
 Identify data to collect and optimal data management processes. 
 Identify and understand users. 
 Conduct an initial feasibility assessment and considerations when choosing a mobile 
platform and mobile devices. 
 Understand the costs and savings involved in implementing a mobile initiative. 
 
 
Why You Need a Strategy 
Developing a strategy for incorporating mobile technology into your work processes is critical. 
The strategy will ensure that the human, material, and financial resources you will need are 
available; that your intervention is appropriate for the project and its context; and that it will 
enhance program management or implementation.  
When developing a strategy, involving all stakeholders is key, including those who will collect 
the data, those who will use or analyze it, and those who will manage the process.  
Chapter 2 discusses how to get started and what questions you should be asking stakeholders 
as you develop the strategic plan. 
Develop a Concept or Strategy Document 
Why It Matters  
It is critical to engage stakeholders at all stages of a project both in order to create buy-in and 
to minimize challenges in operationalizing your mobile strategy later on.  
Toward these ends, a written document outlining your organization’s mobile technology 
concept or strategy is essential. It will definitively communicate what you are doing and the 
rationale behind your activities, so that relevant stakeholders (e.g., mobile end users, funders, 
and staff) can provide feedback early on and reference as needed later on.  
Having your strategy clearly articulated in a document will also help you and your colleagues 
stay on track as you implement your strategy. Finally, having a strategy document will help 
12 
ensure the long-term sustainability of your mobile initiative and will smooth transitions when 
project staff leave the organization or change jobs without it. 
As you move forward and adapt to the rapidly changing field of mobile technology, you can 
improve and update your strategy document as needed. 
What to Cover 
A well-crafted mobile strategy document should describe the following: 
 Purpose of the strategy document (including the challenge that mobile technology use will 
help you to solve) 
 Goals and objectives of the mobile technology strategy  
 Data to be collected via mobile devices 
 Your planned mobile technology feasibility assessment, including: 
—Available network coverage in the areas where you will be working 
—Comfort and experience level of mobile device users 
—Data plans and costs 
—Security issues and management 
—Internal and external technical support required 
 Tools and instruments selected and rationale behind selection 
 General data collection procedures 
 Reports that will be generated 
 Integration of data into other systems 
 Data management and security plan 
Brainstorm How Mobile Data Collection Can Improve Your Project 
To begin, it is important to consider how mobile technology will be useful for your project. 
Think about some problems you are having and how mobile technology can be the solution. 
 Problem: Slow data processing—“Whenever we conduct surveys, data clerks are tasked 
with entering all the data. Given that this is in 
addition to their other work, it takes up to four Myanmar Brainstorming 
months to obtain a completed dataset. This Pact Myanmar wanted to begin to use mobile

result, our data is poor.” 
Solution: Mobile technology made data collection 
 Problem: Lack of geographic data—
“USAID has asked us to map services delivered much more efficient 
to beneficiaries. We need to begin to collect 
Chapter 2: Developing a Strategy and Getting Started   |   13 
GPS data.” 
BRAINSTORMING EXERCISE 
What data collection/dissemination problems are you facing? Is mobile technology a solution 
to any of them? 
When Should You Continue Collecting Data on Paper? 
In some cases, it may not make sense to use mobile technology:   
 Status quo satisfactory—When your data is not urgent and your current system is 
already meeting your standards for quality and efficiency, changing data collection methods 
may not make sense.  
 Security concerns—The cost of having servers host data in country can be prohibitive for 
small data collection exercises. If stakeholders have concerns about the security of data 
leaving the country to an international data host, collecting data on paper may continue to 
make sense. 
 For qualitative data collection—When you are collecting a lot of qualitative data, using 
mobile devices for numeric or even QWERTY-keypad input will limit the amount of 
information that can be entered quickly. If audio capture is possible, it may mitigate this 
issue if the survey is limited in size. Otherwise, paper data collection is most flexible. 
 Use of mobile devices impractical or unsafe—In some areas, using mobiles may make 
data collectors more vulnerable to violence or surveillance. Elsewhere, entering data on a 
mobile device as an interview is in process may be distracting for the respondent or even 
potentially bias responses, as when the respondent is concerned for his or her privacy or 
security. 
It is important to consider the type of data you are collecting and who will be collecting it to 
make sure that the use of mobile technology is appropriate for the context.  
BRAINSTORMING EXERCISE 
What type of data could be most efficiently collected using mobile technology? How might 
you integrate mobile technology into your current data collection activities? 
Identify Your Data 
Based on your brainstorming exercise, think about the data you would like to collect. 
 Indicators—If you are starting a new project, consider which indicators make the most 
sense to collect using mobile technology. 
 Tools—If your project is already underway, think about which data collection tool(s) could 
most appropriately be adapted for mobile data collection.  
Chapter 2: Developing a Strategy and Getting Started   |   14 
 New information—If you could access data for analysis much more quickly after 
collection, as is possible with mobile technology, consider whether there are data that would 
be useful to have that you may not have otherwise have collected (e.g., conflict data). 
 New data types—Remember that with mobile technologies you can collect not only text and 
numerical information but also photos, videos, GPS coordinates, audio, and biometric data. 
REMEMBER 
Mobile technology should simplify your life. For example, think of the large volumes of data 
that are waiting to be entered, or data that people have to travel far to submit. 
Data Management 
Once you identify the relevant questions, data collection tools, and data types for your mobile 
initiative, consider your data management processes to determine which platform will be the most 
cost-effective and best suited to your strategy for incorporating mobile technology into your work.  
 Frequency—How frequently will the data be collected (e.g., “every month”)? 
 Data collectors—How many people are collecting data and how many will require mobile 
devices (e.g., “there will be 10 field workers, and all will need mobile devices”)? 
 The tool—How many items/fields are on the survey/data collection tool (e.g., “the survey is 
15 pages long and has 65 items”)? 
Identify and Understand Users 
As part of the process of deciding whether mobile technology will enhance your data collection 
and management processes, you need to identify and understand the end users of your mobile 
technology. Knowing your users will help you:  
 Obtain the right type and number of mobile devices and appropriate software—
How many mobile devices are needed? What language will the software need to use? Under what 
conditions will the devices be used? (For example, will there be access to power sources? Will 
there be rain or dust that might damage the devices? What level of technology is appropriate for 
the end users? Consider their age,  experience with phones, literacy, and eyesight.  
 Tailor training to the users—The most effective training content and delivery is responsive 
to end users’ level of education, culture, and 
previous exposure to similar technology. Pact Myanmar Mobile Device Users

assumptions you have made as to the appropriateness of mobile technology. Early user 
involvement also has the potential to greatly improve the level of participation and, 
ultimately, the speed and quality of implementation.  
Conduct a Mobile Technology Feasibility Scan
After you have a general idea of how and who will be using mobile data technology in your 
organization, you will want to conduct an initial feasibility scan to help you understand the 
mobile infrastructure and the cultural, political, and economic environment.  This scan will 
help you ensure that your strategy is appropriate and realistic.  Ask: 
 How widespread is network coverage? Which mobile service provider(s) make sense to use? 
If coverage is poor in the targeted area, are WiFi hotspots nearby, or is better coverage 
available elsewhere? 
 What data plans are available, and how much do they cost? 
 What are the data security and management issues to be aware of? Is privacy a 
consideration? 
 What are the legal and regulatory frameworks that might cause concern? 
 How will the use of mobile technology impact gender equity, ethnic relations, and access to 
power and resources? Will the use of mobile technology benefit some groups more than 
others? 
 Will using mobile technology bring unwanted attention to respondents or field workers? 
Will privacy concerns or other factors bias the data in ways that a traditional approach 
would not?

process. 
With so many different mobile devices on the 
market, each with different plans and features, 
choosing a mobile device can be overwhelming. To quickly narrow your options, consider the 
Chapter 2: Developing a Strategy and Getting Started   |   16 
nature of your mobile initiative (one-off versus long-term), data requirements, method of 
transmission, power sources, and budget.  
Nature of Mobile Initiative: Think Long-Term 
If you are starting a new five-year project, you will likely want to invest in technology that will 
grow with you.  Thus, basic cell phones—which will be obsolete in fewer than five years—may 
not be the best choice.  
If you are thinking of acquiring mobile devices for one-time data collection, consider how you 
might use them for another data collection project or for other monitoring purposes; then 
consider what type of phone would be best for all activities. If your mobile initiative is time-
bound and you do not anticipate scaling up or continuing to use mobile technology beyond a 
defined period, ongoing data collection costs (e.g., airtime) and obsolescence will be less of a 
concern. 
Data Collection: Mobile Features and Functions 
Your data requirements will influence your choice of mobile device. Many basic phones on the 
market today come with features previously considered advanced, such as the capacity to take 
photos and videos. However, the quality of the images you collect may not be comparable in 
quality to those of smartphones and other mobile devices with more advanced technology. 
Also, basic phones may not be as reliable or as durable as more advanced devices. 
Some features, such as Internet access and the ability to collect GPS data, are available only on 
more technologically advanced mobile devices.  
Screen size may also be a factor.  
In addition, keep in mind that although Android devices are compatible with most mobile 
platforms, certain mobile devices are incompatible with certain mobile platforms; consult your 
platform requirements before settling on a specific device.   
FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS TO CONSIDER 
 GPS to collect location data. 
 A camera to collect photos. Consider number of pixels you require for adequate image 
quality. 
 Ability to take and store videos on the device. 
 Data storage capacity. In areas with poor network connections, mobile users may need to 
initially store collected data on the phone until they can transmit the data. 
  Ability to block certain uses of the phones and data. This may involve setting a password to 
prevent unauthorized app downloads or an app-blocker that restricts access to inappropriate 
apps, games, etc.  
  Internet capacity. 
  A touch screen. 
Chapter 2: Developing a Strategy and Getting Started   |   17 
  Screen size.  If you will be using long forms to collect data (as opposed to SMS, for 
example), devices with larger screens may be easier to use. Screen size affects how easy images 
are to view on screen as well as how easy it is to type on the device, because of a larger screen 
means a larger on-screen keyboard. 
  Battery life. Access to a source of power is important for mobile users, especially for those 
who are located in or travel frequently to rural or isolated areas where electricity is scarce and 
if the mobile devices you choose are heavy power users. Running out of battery power in the 
middle of data collection can cause delays or even severely disrupt work if no spare battery or 
access to a power source is available. Using backup batteries is possible with many phones, but 
not all. Look at manufacturers’ claims and at battery life during your pilot test in the field. (See 
“Pilot Test the Technology in the Field,” in Chapter 4, Implementing Your Strategy.) Consider 
whether your pilot test battery life meets your needs, given availability of power sources for 
recharging in the field and considering whether your budget can stretch to accommodate the 
cost of auxiliary power devices. 
  Data transmission capability. Mobile devices can transmit data via SMS, GPRS, or both. 
  Language capability. Do both the mobile platform and mobile device you are considering 
accommodate the language(s) and associated alphabet characters you want to use in your 
project? 
  Suitability for your context.  Will the mobile device you are considering be a target for 
thieves, or will it make your subjects uncomfortable, affecting their willingness to speak freely? 
  Durability. Phones with moving parts (e.g., flip phones and slider phones) tend to wear out 
and break more quickly than phones without such moving parts. 
Data Transmission Capabilities: SMS Versus GPRS4 
Important differences in data transmission capabilities will affect your choice of mobile device 
and mobile platform.  
Short message service (SMS) is available on nearly all phones. General packet radio service 
(GPRS) is more advanced but increasingly prevalent. Whereas SMS typically restricts each 
message to 160 characters, GPRS does not effectively limit the size of the form you submit.  
In addition, the system that receives the data sent by a mobile device using SMS is different 
than for a device using GPRS. Whereas SMS is sent to a number recognized on a GSM network, 
GPRS data is submitted directly to your server over the Internet. With SMS, even where it is 
possible to connect your phone to a computer and then receive incoming data (e.g., on the 
FrontlineSMS platform), you can usually receive only a few messages per minute. If you expect 
to receive large volumes of data, you may need to use the service of a third-party SMS gateway 
provider to receive your data and then submit it to your server over the Internet—and this 
service comes at a price.

 If you are using basic phones (e.g., if your initiative is using the personal phones of data 
collectors who do not own more technologically advanced mobile devices—e.g., Java-
enabled feature phones or smartphones). 
 If data submissions are typically 160 characters or fewer in length. 
 If total data volume is low. 
 If data collectors lack Internet access. 
 If your project is a small one-off initiative that will not be scaled up. 
 If data collectors need to send their messages at no cost—that is, if you need the ability to 
reverse-bill SMS. 
WHEN TO USE GPRS (INTERNET)  
 If data collectors are equipped with more technologically advanced phones (e.g., Java-
enabled feature phones or smartphones). 
 If you need to submit large volumes of data at one time. 
 If total data volume is high. 
 If multimedia data (e.g., photos and videos) will be transmitted. 
 If Internet access on the phone or via intermittent connection to wifi is not an issue for data 
collectors. 
Data Collection Client Interface: Fixed-Format SMS, Java Platform, Web-Based Form 
The data collection client interface is what mobile users interact with to enter and transmit 
data. The usability and features of the interface will affect your choice of mobile device and 
what orientation or training you will need to provide to users. The main differences among 
interfaces lie in what phones they can be used with; the requirements for setting up an 
application; how data can be transferred from the phone to your servers; and the interface’s 
ease of use.  
A data collection client interface using fixed-format SMS is the simplest of the three options. 
Most phones are SMS-enabled, and submitting data by SMS requires less orientation or 
training than for other options.  An interface based on a Java platform—usable only on slightly 
more advanced feature phones—allows mobile users to enter and transmit data using GPRS, 
over the Internet when connectivity is available. A data collection client interface using Web-
based forms can be used only on phones that have a Web browser and consistent Internet 
access. The advantage is that data entry and transmission is quick and relatively easy.

cost of airtime for data collection should be very low.  
The size of the files to be sent is small and should not 
be a major factor in a budget unless data is expensive in your country.  Also consider the cost of 
replacement phones (and any additional costs for personal use of your organization’s phones, if 
you are permitting that), as well as the cost of setting up and managing data collection, data 
storage, and data analysis processes. Initial tasks such as training and providing phones and 
airtime, as well as ongoing tasks such as managing data capturers and resolving technical 
problems, require time and resources; don’t underestimate these.  
Weigh the total costs you anticipate over the long term against the expected returns on the 
investment: time savings, faster transmission, increased accuracy of data.   
Next, compare these costs with the costs of managing a paper-based system—printing costs, 
cost of pens and paper, staff time, transportation of supplies, and the like. Although it may not 
be possible to accurately quantify all the efficiency gains associated with using mobile 
technology, some costs should be relatively straightforward to compare.

You can prepare for potential scenarios by creating a Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) 
that outlines how mobile users can prevent and respond to power failure. 
 Use app locks that block access to battery-draining, nonessential applications or simply 
delete other applications from the phone. 
 Turn off WiFi, Bluetooth, and other systems when they are not needed. 
 Turn down brightness to the lowest usable level. 
 Ensure that all users report at the beginning of the day with a fully charged device. 
 Advise staff not to plan on changing batteries of phones due to the potential of data loss. 
 Advise on “emergency” sources of power, such as computer batteries.

Mobile Technology Platforms 
 
 
CHAPTER LEARNING GOALS 
 Gain an understanding of the primary considerations when choosing a mobile platform. 
 Know the characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks of each platform. 
 Choose the best platform based on the needs of your program. 
 
 
Next Steps 
This chapter will summarize the primary components of a mobile platform and provide an in-
depth look at a selection of key platforms.  This is not an endorsement of these platforms, 
rather a review of experience with these platforms that can help you to structure your search 
for the platform that is right for you.  Many other platforms are suited for specialized 
applications, and we encourage you to explore other platforms not included in this chapter to 
find the best fit for your needs. 
Mobile Platform Considerations 
A number of mobile platforms offer a broad range of features and different pricing plans; 
several open-source options come at no cost.  
To determine which platform is right for your mobile initiative, consider your needs and 
overall project budget. To a certain extent, your project’s data needs and the frequency and 
type of data collection outlined in your mobile strategy will help you narrow your options.  
Please keep in mind that platforms are changing rapidly and that features and price structures 
evolve over time; the latest information is always available on the platform’s Web site.  
When deciding among mobile platforms, consider: phone requirements; the data entry 
interface and transmission methods permitted; data storage, analysis, and reporting features; 
miscellaneous features; and the pricing structure.  
Mobile Device Requirements 
What type of mobile device (i.e., basic phone, feature phone, smartphone, or tablet) do you 
need for your mobile data collection? See “Decide on a Mobile Platform and Mobile Devices,” 
Chapter 2, above.  
23 
Also, is there flexibility in your choice of phone or are you limited to phones that you or your 
data collectors already have? Not all mobile platforms may be compatible with all types of 
phones or with all models. Be sure to consult the platform Web site or online forum before 
making a decision. 
Data Entry Interface and Transmission 
The platform’s data collection interface will affect how data collectors can enter data into their 
mobile devices. How easy it is depends largely on the type of data and transmission method 
(e.g., via SMS, forms, or Web portal). To compare different data types and transmission 
methods, see “Data Transmission Capabilities: SMS Versus GPRS” in Chapter 2.  Platforms 
where data is entered on forms or online portals can offer such features as skip logic, which can 
significantly reduce data collection time.  
Data Storage, Analysis, and Reporting 
Are data stored on a local server or on a server in the cloud (i.e., remotely)? Platforms that use 
GPRS and cloud computing often incorporate security features to ensure that all data 
transmission is encrypted and secure. Data entered via GPRS or online typically disappears 
from a mobile device after it is transmitted; data that is sent by SMS or stored on the device for 
later transmission or transfer to a server is generally more vulnerable, as the phone can be 
stolen or lost and text messages accessed. Most platforms offer some form of basic analysis or 
reporting, but the quality and range of the visualizations (e.g., maps, charts) varies.  
Additional Features 
Platforms vary in other ways. The ability to collect and visualize audio, images, and video 
differs from one platform to the next. The same is true for language options. Most platforms 
permit questions in the language installed on your computer or mobile device, but sometimes 
coding makes this difficult and not all alphabets are available. Some platforms come in such 
common languages as Spanish, French, and Kiswahili. 
Pricing Structure 
Some platforms’ pricing structure will be more cost-effective than others’ for your mobile data 
collection; it will depend on how frequently you plan to collect data, the length of the survey 
(i.e., the number of questions), and the external support you need.  
Most platforms allow at least a free trial, so if you find several that appear to meet your needs, 
test them out before committing. (See Appendix 2, “Pact Swaziland Case Study: Selecting a 
Mobile Platform.”) Most platform pricing does not include airtime costs; these fees depend on 
the mobile network you are using. Typically, it costs vastly less to send surveys over data 
networks (e.g., GPRS, WiFi, 2G/3G/4G) than by SMS. 
PRICING MODELS 
 Open source—Use of the platform is completely free. 
Chapter 3: Mobile Technology Platforms   |   24 
 Freemium—Basic service is freely available, but to use the platform at scale or to take 
advantage of such extras as SMS or technical support set-up, you must subscribe (for SMS) 
or pay a one-time fee (usually for set-up and usually somewhat steep). 
 Pay as you go—You pay just for the amount of data collected. 
 Subscription—After a trial period, you pay a monthly or yearly fee to use the service. 
PRICING RESOURCES 
Mobile Data Toolkit—A database of services and software useful for international 
development and social change work using mobile devices. Only a handful of mobile platforms 
are currently reviewed, but more are being added.   http://mobile.ictdev.org/ 
NOMAD Selection Assistant—A good starting point. After you complete a survey on this 
Web site, it will match you with the appropriate mobile data collection solution(s) among the 
24 in the site’s database. However, the database may not contain the most recent information 
on the different mobile platforms. http://humanitarian-nomad.org/online-selection-tool/ 
Mobenzi 
Mobenzi, a South African firm founded in 2006, has a versatile data collection platform, 
Mobenzi Researcher, that can be used to conduct surveys.6 It can operate without network 
coverage; users can upload data after they return to an area with coverage. 
Pros 
 The database makes it easy to present survey data clearly, to manage and share results, and 
to use GPS data to monitor and communicate with field workers. 
 Surveys are easy to set up on the Web.  
 The same easy interface works on a restricted but still fairly large number of phones, 
including both feature phones and smartphones.  
 Can accommodate several data collection forms. 
 Data stored on the phone until the form is complete and then automatically sends as soon as 
there is a connection (improved data security). 
Cons 
 SMS data collection is permitted, but data entry is tricky. 
 Does not work with Apple products (iPod, iPhone). 
 Scrolling “back” to check on answers is tricky. 
                                                   
6 Mobenzi provides two other platforms: Mobenzi Outreach, for community health care data collection by community health workers, and 
Mobenzi Intelligence, which supports outsourcing of basic tasks and data analysis that cannot be automated by a computer. The pricing 
models, target markets, and purposes for these platforms are different than for Mobenzi Researcher. In this handbook, the term “Mobenzi” will 
refer solely to the Mobenzi Researcher data collection platform. 
Chapter 3: Mobile Technology Platforms   |   25 
Features 
 Data collection surveys.  The original platform was specifically designed for health research. 
 Capable of advanced level skip logic, which enhances data integrity. 
 Works with multiple languages. 
 Image and GPS capabilities. 
 Compatible with entry level and higher level smartphones 
 Operates with limited connectivity. 
 Technical support available, although at extra cost. 
Cost 
Mobenzi has a pay-as-you-go pricing model, without setup or subscription costs. The only set 
cost is for transmission of completed surveys—generally $.01 per data field (a data field being a 
question or a small image). Example:  
 A survey with 100 questions: 100 x .01 = $1.00 per survey. 
 And 600 respondents: 600 x $1.00 = $600. 
SURVEY SETUP 
 Create your own survey = $0. 
Or  
 400 rand (approximately $40) per hour for technical support. 
OTHER SUPPORT  
 800–1000 rand per hour (approximately $80–$100 per hour).

CommCare 
The CommCare platform, a product of the Cambridge, Massachusetts–based Dimagi—a 
privately owned social enterprise that brings innovative technology to help underserved 
communities around the world—can be used both to collect data for field surveys and the 
platform’s paid plans also support sending informational SMSs to a wide audience. CommCare 
has typically been used for health programs.  
All data collected with CommCare is sent over a cellular data network to a remote cloud based 
server. When connectivity is not available, users can operate offline. Data is saved on the phone 
and can be sent automatically when connectivity is restored. After the collected data is 
transmitted to the CommCare cloud server, it can be viewed in standard reports.  
Chapter 3: Mobile Technology Platforms   |   26 
 
Pros  
 Survey setup is easy with the CommCare application builder; the large online support 
community can help. 
 The free version permits use by up to 50 individuals.  
 Authorized users can download data to Excel or to other third-party applications. 
Cons 
 It is possible to have only one form at a time on a phone—limiting if you are managing 
several different types of data.  
 The free version does not permit SMS. 
Features 
 Data collection surveys. 
 Applications to prompt health care workers or other development workers to provide 
accurate information or to analyze information in the field can be developed for extra cost. 
 Multimedia enabled (e.g., with capability to gather images, audio, and video). 
 Supports multiple languages. 
 Two-way communication, remotely manage fieldworkers. 
 Image and GPS capabilities. 
 Java and Android compatible. 
 SMS capabilities available in pay plans. 
 Survey set-up support available (at additional cost) 
Cost 
The free plan not only allows up to 50 mobile users but also includes multimedia support and 
gives you the ability to create your own applications, data exporting, and standard reports.  
Paid subscription plans vary from $100 per month (“standard”) to $1,000 per month 
(“advanced”) and offer SMS capabilities, extra data analytical and reporting features, and 
additional technical support, among other features.  
There are full service packages that include building applications and a full system for a 
project.  While they are expensive, they are worth considering for projects where grant money 
will be used to set up the system, as on-going costs are lower.

Magpi 
Magpi, recognized as a leader in the field, is a versatile program for data collection that has 
been used extensively by USAID, the World Bank, and others to collect data from programs 
ranging from education to health and governance.   
Pros 
 The extensive basic dashboard that presents data results cleanly and clearly and that 
facilitates data visualization and analysis.  
 The online tool that makes creating surveys easy. 
 Advanced programmable skip logic and easier-to-use basic skip logic both available.  
Cons 
 Only a few languages built in. (However, Magpi will add a language if you provide the 
translation, and there is no restriction on the alphabets that can be used.) 
Features 
 Data collection surveys. 
 Easy to build surveys with skip logic. 
 Free basic version, with good technical support (at extra cost). 
 Works on Java, Android, Blackberry, and Apple products. 
 GPS capability. 
 Works without Internet connectivity.  
 SMS data collection capability at Pro levels. 
 SMS, text-to-speech (TTS), and audio messaging service for communication (will be 
combined with data collection system for improved integration in summer 2014).  
Costs 
Magpi is free to use, subject to certain limits on forms per account, questions per form, uploads 
per month, and online data storage. Many projects and organizations find the free version to be 
adequate for their needs. However, medium or large-sized evaluations (with 1,000 or more 
respondents) or organizations engaged in large ongoing mobile monitoring may require the 
Pro or Enterprise paid subscription-based versions. The cost of this per project would be 
significantly less if you were to spread it across multiple projects and/or countries.

Chapter 3: Mobile Technology Platforms   |   28 
FrontlineSMS 
FrontlineSMS is widely used, open source software that can be used to manage information 
gathered using mobile devices. Offering a simple, cost-effective way to collect and disseminate 
data to users, it requires Java-enabled phones, and data inputs (i.e., text messages) are length-
restricted; long survey forms are unrealistic. Because FrontlineSMS runs on software installed 
on a single, stand alone computer, it does not require an Internet connection.   
FrontlineSMS makes it easy to create and manage common SMS activities such as 
announcements, polling, and automatically replying to incoming SMSs.  Incoming data from 
poll activity can be visualized; users can quickly understand results. Compatible with most 
other platforms and applications, it can be used alongside other tools (e.g., Crowdmap, for real-
time GIS mapping). 
FrontlineForms, introduced in 2009, combines the power of Java-enabled mobiles with SMS. 
The Forms module is more versatile than FrontlineSMS in that allows you to create, on your 
computer, copies of simple paper forms, and then send them to a Java-enabled phone by text 
message. It is a good tool for collecting simple survey data but because text messages in most 
languages are traditionally capped at about 160 characters, lengthy surveys are not really 
possible. 
The FrontlineCloud module allows users to send and receive data over GPRS, WiFi, 2G/3G/4G, 
or similar networks. More data can be sent faster and usually at a cost lower than for an SMS. 
However, unlike FrontlineSMS, which is free to use, the cloud version requires a subscription, 
which costs $10 a month. 
Pros 
 Open source and software free to download and use.  
 Will run on even very low-end Java phones. 
 Simple and relatively low startup cost. 
 Allows for two-way SMS communication with data collectors, including polling and 
visualization of incoming responses. 
 Form designer included in FrontlineSMS Forms module. 
 Active online community helpful in troubleshooting. 
 Advanced skip logic included. 
 Data export into Excel possible. 
Cons  
 The Forms client is not open source and is thus not customizable. 
 Limited to SMS for data transmission, which can be expensive. 
 SMS typically limits data transmissions to about 160 characters; no GPRS support. 
Chapter 3: Mobile Technology Platforms   |   29 
Features 
 Supports polling via SMS and distribution of informational messages.  
 Free software; costs limited to equipment and data usage. 
 Two-way communication channel. 
 Group folders for targeted messages. 
 Compatible with any SMS-enabled mobile device. 
Costs 
 Modem and unlocked SIM card. 
 Software setup is free if you do it yourself; FrontlineSMS consultant services available for a 
fee.

Crowdmap 
An open-source platform for information collection, visualization, and interactive mapping, 
Crowdmap is oriented towards mapping geospatial information. Crowdmap is one of a suite of 
platforms associated with Ushahidi. Meaning “testimony” or “witness” in Swahili, Ushahidi 
was developed in Kenya in 2008 to map incidents of violence and peace efforts based on 
reports submitted by phone or over the Web. Crowdmap is essentially Ushahidi in the cloud, a 
hosted version that does not require the user to set up the system on their own server.  
The Crowdmap platform enables real-time, spatial information sharing and interaction 
involving an unlimited number of users. As a result, it has been used effectively for disaster 
management and response.  
Ushahidi also offers another popular product known as Swift River. Swift River is not a data 
collection platform like Crowdmap. Instead, Swift River receives unstructured data (i.e., 
descriptive text messages) and then codes this data into a structured format by variables (e.g., 
location, time, event, user group). By coding and sorting data and utilizing algorithms set by 
users, Swift River enables data to be cross-analyzed in different ways. Content can be then 
aggregated, clustered, searched, and filtered according to user requirements.  
Chapter 3: Mobile Technology Platforms   |   30 
Pros 
 Strong information visualization and sharing. 
 Can receive and organize unstructured data (i.e., text). 
 Can collect and aggregate reports from the news, Twitter, e-mail, SMS, or any other 
electronic source; reports are then geo-located.  
 Easy to set up and use. 
 Supports multiple languages. 
Cons 
 Requires a reasonable level of technical know-how to use Ushahidi online platforms.   
 Not designed for data collection. (Developed primarily as an information-sharing platform, 
although Swift River now includes data synthesis and analysis features.) 
Features 
 Crowdsourcing information possible via SMS, e-mail, and Twitter. 
 Interactive maps possible to visualize data. 
 Capacity to tap into local knowledge to map ongoing events or conduct assessments. 
 Data storage in the cloud. 
 Free to use and maintain. 
Cost 
The Crowdmap platform is completely free to use.  Ushahidi offers consulting services to help 
set up and tailor projects as well as to train staff on the platform.  However, these services are 
not essential, because the program is very easy to use.

Next Steps  
Now that you have developed your strategy and have defined your mobile technology goals and 
objectives, taking into consideration your specific project needs and constraints and selected 
your platform, you are ready to begin implementation. The following pages will walk you 
through important logistical considerations and implementation steps recommended as you 
roll out mobile technology. 
Plan to Obtain and Manage Your Mobile Devices 
Procurement 
Do not underestimate how long it will take to procure mobile devices. Depending on how many 
you need, it may be difficult to obtain all your devices from one vendor. Online vendors have a 
larger stock but usually require a credit card to purchase.   
SUGGESTED ONLINE DISTRIBUTERS OF MOBILES AND TABLETS 
 3G Mobile—3G Mobile supplies and distributes mobile phones and tablets to major 
retailers in South Africa and throughout Africa.  http://www.3gmobile.co.za/ 
 GSM-Superstore—Located in South Florida, GSM-Superstore exports unlocked new and 
factory-refurbished GSM phones in most international brands and models to Latin America, 
the Caribbean, and other parts of the world. http://gsm-superstore.com/about-us/ 
Inventorying Your Phones 
You will want to inventory your mobile devices. This entails labeling them with an inventory 
number as well as the data collection log-in information (if relevant and compatible with 
34 
security needs) to minimize problems in the field. It’s optimal to track IMEI, SIM card, and 
battery serial numbers in a centralized database, along with associated users, to better monitor 
data submission.  
Mobile devices typically have an electronic serial number known as an IMEI (international 
mobile equipment identity). To find the IMEI for a mobile device, simply enter the following 
five-digit string of characters as if you were dialing a phone number: *#06#. The IMEI should 
automatically display. Alternatively, look for the IMEI on a label underneath the battery. With 
Android phones, go to the home screen, press Menu, then Settings, then About Phone, and 
then Status. Your IMEI will become visible on the screen.  
Be sure to inform all staff and data collection workers that the phones, SIM cards, and batteries 
have been inventoried and are associated with a unique user. This knowledge will encourage 
them to take better care of their phones and discourage such practices as swapping out the 
battery from the new mobile device for an older battery from an older mobile device. 
Ownership  
If you are distributing mobile devices to data collectors, determine early on in your project 
whether ownership will reside with your organization or with the collector and under what 
conditions. For nonroutine data collection such as evaluation surveys, it likely makes more 
sense to issue and collect devices at the end of data collection. However, for routine data 
collection, consider giving the devices to the collectors, either upon issuing them or after a 
period of time. There may be lower levels of loss, theft, and breakage among data collectors 
who own or expect to own their mobile devices. Secondly, after a few years of use, the devices 
will likely become obsolete and would not be used for future projects. Lastly, managing a large 
inventory of devices takes time—time that you won’t spend if the data collectors themselves 
own the devices.  
It is important to have an official policy that addresses ownership as well as the consequences 
for loss, breakage, or theft of mobile devices.  
Build Your Forms for Mobile Data Collection 
If you are collecting more characters of data at any one time than is permitted for the language 
you’re using for your mobile device (i.e., 160 characters for English), it is likely that you are not 
using SMS to transmit data but rather the Web, which allows data collectors to enter their data 
into a form either on the mobile device itself or by accessing an online portal.  
Pay close attention to the form design—it affects the quality of the data collected and the ease 
with which a survey can be completed. Mobile technology alone will not build a good survey! 
To make sure that you have included all your questions and that the skip logic is clear, the best 
course is to design the form on paper first. Doing so gives you the opportunity to reconsider 
Chapter 4: Implementing Your Strategy   |   35 
what data you really want to collect and will use as well as to eliminate duplicate questions—
which tend to occur more frequently on electronic forms than on paper forms.  
The format of forms on a mobile device differs from that of paper forms, and survey tables on 
paper do not translate well to mobile devices.   
REMEMBER  
In general, limiting the number of qualitative entries will yield stronger, cleaner data.  Even 
if open-ended questions, it is preferable to add what you expect may be some common 
answers as multiple-choice options and, in addition, leave a space for “other.”

Unique Identifiers 
A good practice when creating forms is to put a unique identifier at the top of each form. This 
code will allow you to more easily, later, match the respondent or subject (e.g., if you are 
surveying the same person repeatedly) or locate the record (e.g., as part of a data quality audit). 
Field workers will need to enter this code into a separate sheet. If you are piloting the data 
Chapter 4: Implementing Your Strategy   |   36 
collection tool or simply practicing, assign a “dummy” code (e.g., 555), so that you can 
recognize data that are not part of the dataset. 
Some operators of mobile platforms (e.g., Mobenzi, CommCare) offer assistance in developing 
survey forms. Platform operators that do not offer such assistance often have good basic 
training materials; some provide training. Many platforms profiled in this manual have online 
troubleshooting forums, and most are responsive to questions.  
REMEMBER 
Test your form on the Internet or on your phone before sharing it with others! 
Setting Up Mobile Devices 
After you have settled on a platform and acquired your mobile devices, you can begin setting 
them up and downloading software—sometimes from the platform Web site, or, if you have an 
Android phone, from the Google Play store. Several platforms permit you to download software 
from a link in an e-mail. If your mobile device lacks Internet access, you can probably 
download to a personal computer and transfer the software to your phone using a cable or a 
USB key. 
Be sure to install the software before introducing the phone to users, to give yourself a chance 
to test the application, become familiar with its functionality, and troubleshoot if necessary. Do 
not underestimate how long phone set-up can take.  It is best to have all of the phones set up 
with the application(s) you are planning to use prior to any training or pilot event. 
Below are step-by-step instructions on how to install each of several key mobile platforms. 
Mobenzi 
 Go to the Mobenzi Web site: http://www.mobenzi.com/r/apps/ 
 Choose the mobile device you are working with. 
 Click on the link to download. (You may have to navigate to the download folder in your 
phone to install.) 
Or 
 After you have registered the phone in the platform, a link to download the software can be 
sent to a phone via SMS. 
CommCare/Dimagi 
 Download CommCare from the Google Play store. Two options: 
—Go to bit.ly/getccodk. 
—Go to the Google Play store and search for “CommCare ODK v2.”

—Restore your settings when you have finished. 
 When the download is complete, the application will open. 
Pilot Test the Technology in the Field 
Pilot testing phones in the field allows the team to identify data collection issues early and 
avoid unforeseen complications. Allocate two days for field-testing the mobile devices, the 
survey platform, and the survey questions. To allow time to address technical issues and refine 
the survey, schedule the test at least three days before beginning data-collector training.  
To conduct a pilot test, anticipate and recreate the conditions of the actual survey to the 
greatest extent possible. When planning a pilot test, consider: 
 Location—The test should occur in the field, preferably as close as possible to the area to be 
surveyed. This will help flag any data connectivity issues that may require offline data 
Chapter 4: Implementing Your Strategy   |   38 
collection and thus adjustments to phone settings. Any lack of access to electricity in the 
field will reveal the mobile devices’ operative battery life. If batteries do not last long enough 
to go from charge to charge with life to spare, you will need to provide additional batteries or 
plan for midday charging.  
 Duration—The pilot test should replicate two full days of data collection. Confirming that 
the phones work in the field is not enough. The biggest drains on phones’ batteries are the 
screen and the cellular radio. Manufacturers often overestimate how long a phone will run 
on one charge, so you cannot rely on the specifications on the box. Only keeping phones in 
full operation for an entire day will reveal how long the battery lasts under field conditions. 
 Test subjects—Running through the survey several times with a variety of respondents will 
reveal any problems with skip patterns or the flow of questions. Potential test subjects could 
include office staff not affiliated with the survey, residents not living in the area to be 
surveyed, even data collection workers. Be sure to test every skip pattern to ensure that no 
logic errors exist and that the survey skips to the appropriate question in every situation. 
 Error reporting—Devise an efficient system for reporting errors that occur during the 
pilot test. Even minor glitches need to be addressed to ensure that the actual survey goes 
smoothly. Any deviation from expected operation of the platform, the survey, or the devices 
themselves should be logged. 
 Submitting data—Although pilot test data will eventually be purged from the final survey, 
be sure to upload it to check for platform connection problems and to ensure that project 
staff can receive responses from the field. Delete pilot test data from both devices and 
platform before beginning the real survey. 
 Receiving data—Office staff members play a critical role in the pilot test even though they 
are not in the field. Those who will be monitoring the survey should confirm that the data 
being sent in from the field display correctly—both survey responses and any GPS data. 
Customized dashboards should be created, and staff members should familiarize themselves 
with the platform’s monitoring and reporting capabilities. 
 Backup plan: Have a day’s worth of paper surveys on hand in case the technology fails.  
Remember, although pilot testing may seem 
excessive, it is better to discover issues before you Taking GPS Locations

obstructions. If you don’t have a clear view of the sky, 
your location will not be recorded accurately. 
 
Chapter 4: Implementing Your Strategy   |   39 
Recruit and Train Data Collectors 
No matter how well the mobile technology works in the field, insufficient training of data 
collectors can compromise the survey—and data collection utilizing mobile devices requires a 
higher level of technological literacy and competency than data collection on paper. Recruiting 
qualified candidates and providing rigorous training are both key to a successful survey.  
Recruiting 
During recruitment, ask about candidates’ familiarity with the mobile device to be used, and 
then test their familiarity by having them send and receive SMS notifications, make and answer 
calls, monitor battery life and device connectivity, navigate through menus (if any), 
troubleshoot problems, and properly care for the device. 
Training 
Conduct training both on basic operation of the mobile device and on how to conduct the 
survey on the platform you have chosen. Integrate standard training on research skills, 
interview techniques, and traditional survey delivery with training on mobile technology.  
Allocating two days is optimal, to allow users to become familiar with the device and platform 
and to acquire sufficient hands-on experience.  
SUGGESTED AGENDA 
 Overview of project and goals. 
 Overview of survey objectives. 
 Basic research and interview skills. 
 Overview of the mobile device being used and its operation. 
 Explanation of the buttons and symbols on the screen (e.g., battery and reception). 
 How to send and receive SMS notifications. 
 How to download new versions of the survey. 
 How to ensure that surveys are sent. 
 Daily maintenance procedures (e.g., charging the device and connecting to send data). 
 Policy on airtime, making calls, sending SMS, etc. 
 Policy on lost, stolen, or damaged phones. 
 Practice conducting the survey with other data collectors acting as the respondents. 
Collect Data 
Purging Pilot Test Data 
Before beginning data collection, take measures to ensure that no pilot test or training data can 
be confused with actual survey data. Take the time to clearly identify—or preferably, to delete— 
all data and surveys both from your mobile devices themselves and from the central database. 
In the rush of commencing a survey, it may seem more convenient to separate test data from 
actual data after the survey is complete, using either the collection date as a divider or by 
Chapter 4: Implementing Your Strategy   |   40 
filtering out data that is incomplete or that contains the word “test.” Because this practice may 
compromise data quality, the best policy is to wipe out everything that could be misconstrued 
as real data—and only then initiate formal data collection. 
If You Revise the Survey 
At the same time you delete test data, make sure that the most recent survey is downloaded to 
each device on the first day. If any revisions are made during data collection, be sure that the 
new version is downloaded to each mobile device as quickly as possible and versions deleted to 
keep them from being used. 
Changes to Field Supervision Procedures and Troubleshooting 
As data collection effort begins in earnest, staff should be prepared, both in the office and in 
the field, to monitor and troubleshoot the technology if issues arise.  
Office staff may also monitor the performance of individuals through the reporting platform 
and use the information for performance management. A particular individual’s dispatching of 
numerous surveys from a single GPS location may arise from a technical difficulty—or it may 
flag false data entry intended to speed the data collector’s work. Similarly, consistent 
underreporting by some workers relative to their colleagues may highlight a need for additional 
training—or it may point to excessive break time. Make sure that office staff review GPS 
locations and time stamps for all collected data and contact individual data collectors about 
their performance if necessary. 
Office staff should also monitor incoming data for repeating errors on the part of more than 
one data collector. Additional instruction may resolve the problem—or the questionnaire may 
require revision. 
Keep in mind that mobile and electronic surveying can both greatly reduce requirements for 
field oversight and improve communication between office staff and data collectors. Rather 
than waiting to speak with a worker face to face, monitoring staff can be in contact by SMS or 
by phone, depending on connectivity and airtime policy. Alerts for a new version of the survey 
can be broadcast and a confirming response requested from data collectors after they have 
made the update.  
Follow Up with Data Collectors 
Exercise the same diligence at the end of the survey as at the beginning. Take time to ensure 
that all surveys on all phones have been sent and uploaded. Check in any equipment that will 
be reused. Deal with lost, stolen, or broken equipment following official policies.  
Checking for Data Quality 
Mobile data collection greatly reduces the time and resources needed to clean and process data, 
compared to paper-based surveys. However, data quality checks to ensure that are suitable for 
analysis are still a good idea. For example, if a new version of your questionnaire was 
Chapter 4: Implementing Your Strategy   |   41 
distributed at any point during the survey, check data collected before the update to ensure 
that it corresponds correctly to the newer data.  
Data Analysis 
As data analysis begins, basic visualizations provided by the platform serve as a good starting 
point. Export the data from the platform in the appropriate format to the data analysis tool of 
your choice to conduct more robust analysis.  
Look Ahead 
Be sure to document lessons learned and how the data was used for decision making. Sharing 
not only the data but also information about its collection, about the challenges and 
opportunities brought because of the use of mobile technology, and about the findings of your 
analysis will help speed adoption of mobile technology among other actors. Consider sharing 
read-only data and data visualizations with the collectors themselves as well as with other 
stakeholders such as donors, government ministries, and chief strategy officers.  
As you consider how you might integrate mobile technology into your programming, 
continuously scan your environment for innovations in ICT4D. If you yourself encounter 
challenges relating to the integration of ICT4D into your data collection, or opportunities for 
doing so, we encourage you to share your story with the broader ICT4D community via 
LinkedIn groups and professional networks specializing in mobile technology and ICT4D. You 
may find others in the development field who have grappled with the same issues or that you 
are in fact breaking new ground! 
We hope that you find the materials in this Mobile Technology Handbook helpful and 
informative. In Appendix 3, you will find additional online resources for using mobile 
technology. There are of course many other resources available on the Internet. Mobile 
technology is changing rapidly with each passing day, so be sure to stay abreast of all the latest 
developments. 
We wish you the best of luck in getting started with mobile technology.

Pact’s Mobile Technology Use 
 
 
Pact uses mobile technology to facilitate data collection that is faster, cleaner, better 
monitored, and made richer by integrated GIS and camera capabilities.  A data collection form 
is made through an online platform and sent to data collectors, monitoring staff, or 
beneficiaries—individuals who can respond via SMS, on simple mobile devices, or using 
smartphone applications.  Collected data is immediately sent to a cloud-based central database, 
and results can be reviewed for quality control and analyzed as they come in.  Data that needs 
to be collected on paper can be entered later into the database through a Web portal.  Workers 
must be trained to use the technology just as they must be to use any form. Mobile technology 
permits real-time data monitoring, eliminates the need for data entry and data double entry, 
and makes it possible to immediately grasp and respond to common issues. 
Pact has been using mobile technology since 2007 to enhance project activities and to improve 
monitoring and facilitate evaluation, and launched an intensive training and adaptation period 
in 2011 to familiarize individuals on all projects with the potential of using mobile technology.  
Pact has utilized a number of platforms, including FrontlineSMS, Mobenzi, and Magpi.  Some 
examples of our experience with mobile technology follow.  
Pact Activities Using Mobile Technology 
 
43 
Africa 
South Sudan 
Pact tested the viability of mobile technology in South Sudan in March 2013 and found several 
viable platforms.  Development of forms for the National Civil Society Strengthening project is 
ongoing.  Pact is also developing mobile technology for the Access to Justice project to monitor 
court cases and legal aid support. Contact: Rachel Beck, rbeck@pactworld.org. 
Tanzania 
The baseline for a quasi-experimental evaluation design on programming for orphans and 
vulnerable children (OVC) was conducted using mobile technology for data collection. This 
rigorous evaluation will track changes in key child outcomes among intervention and 
nonintervention communities and will measure the program’s attribution towards results.  
In Tanzania, Pact has also used mobile technology to collect baseline data in artisanal and 
small-scale mining on behalf of the Ministry of Energy and Minerals. Data documented 
household economy, child labor in mining, and health and safety, as well as alternative 
livelihoods for artisanal and small-scale miners. Contact: Daisy Kisyombe, 
dkisyombe@pactworld.org. 
Namibia 
Pact used Mobenzi to survey staff at partner organizations on their perception of capacity 
development assistance rendered by Pact Namibia.  This exercise was part of a Pact-wide 
community of practice meeting, where Pact monitoring and evaluation staff from around the 
world were trained in mobile data collection and then went into the field to collect data. 
Contact: Stephanie Posner, sposner@pactworld.org. 
Swaziland 
Pact developed the capacity of its local partner, Save the Children, to use mobile technology to 
collect child profiling data on OVC in Swaziland. The survey employed mobile phones to collect 
data on OVC status and needs. GPS coordinates were also collected to map service coverage 
and target areas with high need.  Contact: Sam Kuhlande, skuhlande@pactworld.org. 
Nigeria 
In 2013, a project in Nigeria developed an innovative mobile application to provide tailored 
health education messages to registered HIV-positive pregnant women on testing and prenatal 
care.  This system tracks patients and provides health workers with messages to follow up with 
patients who have not returned for their appointments. A baseline survey of this population 
using mobile technology was also conducted.  Contact: Olufemi Akinmade, 
oakinmade@pactworld.org.

Ethiopia 
Pact trained implementing partners to provide basic data results to improve the rapidity of 
data availability to program decision makers.  Contact:  Metalign Ayehu, 
mayehu@pactworld.org. 
Asia / Eurasia 
Nepal 
Pact used mobile technology for a major baseline survey data collection in 2013.  A SMS-based 
conflict reporting system that will monitor conflict in real time using on-the-ground reporters 
has been developed. Contact:  Raju Kandel, rkandel@pactworld.org. 
Thailand 
Here, Pact used Android-based phones and the Mobenzi platform to collect baseline OVC data.  
Contact: Worachanok Youttananukorn, worachanok@pactworld.org. 
Cambodia 
Pact uses FrontlineSMS as part of a participatory monitoring, reporting, and verification 
system to prevent deforestation. Community monitors were trained in the technology and send 
in regular reports on observed activities as a standard SMS form, supplemented with GIS data 
collected simultaneously.  Contact:   Sarah Sitts, ssitts@pactworld.org. 
Myanmar 
Coca Cola funded the savings group project, Swan-yi, which used Magpi and Android 
smartphones to collect baseline data on women enrolling in savings groups in central 
Myanmar.  Because SIM cards were prohibitively expensive, data collectors uploaded all data 
collected at once from central WiFi points.  Now, Pact’s Shae Thot project is beginning to test 
Magpi for part of its regular maternal and child health monitoring and data collection. 
Contact:   Jade Lamb, jlamb@pactworld.org. 
Vietnam 
In Vietnam, Pact will conduct a baseline survey of a WORTH project (similar to that in 
Myanmar) during 2014.  Contact:  Dang Thi Thanh Binh,  dtbinh@pactworld.org. 
Ukraine 
Pact’s partner in the Ukraine, the International HIV/AIDS Alliance, plans to implement a data 
collection survey and then to build an information portal using GIS technology.  In 2014, the 
RESPOND project will also map services for vulnerable populations in three regions, using 
mobile mapping techniques, to demonstrate lack of access outside of regional centers.  
Contact:   Alyona Gerasimova, agerasimova@pactworld.org. 
Kyrgyzstan 
In Kyrgyzstan, under the Civic Advocacy for Reform and Stabilization (CARS) project, Pact 
staff provided training to CARS grantees on the use of free FrontlineSMS software to send and 
Appendix 1: Pact’s Mobile Technology Use   |   45 
receive text messages and to manage relevant information.  One key grantee, Legal Assistance 
to Rural Citizens (LARC), used the technology to conduct a land tenure rights awareness 
campaign and a survey on land tenure rights. To spur public debate around social and political 
issues in Kyrgyzstan, radio stations used text messaging to make programming more 
interactive, increasing listener participation and enhancing public debate.  
Mongolia 
Nomadic herders who were previously state supported and have become business operators in 
a market-based economy are now able to make better business decisions about how to time 
sales of primary produce. Herders can maximize their profits by making data-based decisions 
using factual, real-time market price information. Pact Mongolia’s national network of market 
watchers gathered prices for 64 commodities in local markets five days a week. Information 
and communication technology enabled prices to be sent to a central database for daily, 
weekly, and quarterly analysis and distribution. This market information was broadcast via 
radio, television, and text message, through a Mongolian cell phone provider working in 
partnership with Pact. More than 700 text message price requests were received during the 
first three months of 2007. The service was especially valuable during the depth of winter, one 
of the most trying times for herding-dependent businesses, with fewer commodities to sell and 
extreme weather conditions.  
Latin America 
Brazil 
Here, Pact developed a partnership with a leading telecommunication company (Vivo) to send 
educational SMS messages to all male clients aged 18 or above in Recife, Rio de Janeiro, and 
Federal District based on the area code of clients’ cellular phones. The first SMS included a 
short message providing the number of people in Brazil who were estimated to be HIV positive 
but did not know their status, and then provided the link to the program’s blog, where 
recipients could find more information about local HIV testing sites. By monitoring the 
number of hits to the program’s blog, Pact was able to determine that SMS messages increased 
Web site usage. At each HIV testing location, clients were asked to identify how they learned of 
this testing site, allowing for the effectiveness of SMS messaging promoting voluntary 
counseling and HIV testing to be monitored.  
El Salvador and the Dominican Republic 
Inadequate access to information on worker rights and responsibilities generates barriers to 
labor justice. To address this issue, Pact initiated a project to train attorneys, free-legal- 
assistance providers, and labor rights advocates on the efficient, cost-effective use of SMS to 
communicate with stakeholders and disseminate labor rights information. Pact trained 
attorneys and labor rights advocates in El Salvador and the Dominican Republic on 
FrontlineSMS software. Pact’s partners sent text messages directly to the cellular phones of 
workers involved in labor disputes. These messages included notifications and reminders 
Appendix 1: Pact’s Mobile Technology Use   |   46 
about important events (e.g., court dates and upcoming labor rights trainings). In addition, 
Pact's partners used FrontlineSMS technology to carry out labor rights public awareness 
campaigns, conduct surveys, and refer workers to free legal assistance services. Four 
organizations used FrontlineSMS to disseminate labor rights information.

The above cost analysis of the different platforms shows that platform C would be the most 
cost-effective. However, functionality and features were also considerations. 
Swaziland tested both platforms A and C in country and ultimately decided to go with platform 
A. Despite the higher costs, the platform A’s functionality and features were a better fit for Pact 
Swaziland’s data collection needs.  
REMEMBER 
Although cost is a big factor, it should not be the only factor.

and government. The report also explores the consequences for development of the emerging 
“app economy,” summarizing current thinking and seeking to inform the debate on the use of 
mobile devices for development. It’s no longer about the phone itself but about how it is used 
and about the content and applications that mobile devices bring.

Mobile Solution Selection Data (NOMAD) 
This online questionnaire determines data needs and existing resources connected with a 
particular project, then filters them through the capabilities of more than 30 mobile platforms 
to propose all possible workable solutions. Although NOMAD is useful for sorting through the 
increasingly crowded market space, it is optimal to go through the survey several times and 
adjust your responses, wherever a constraint is not critical, in order to obtain a full list of 
potentially workable solutions. Remember that platforms are constantly adding new 
capabilities, and the NOMAD tool may or may not be up to date.
