mHealth Strategy (among others!)
Wireless Reach programs aim to develop the global ecosystem by:
Encouraging scalable solutions by targeting diseases and conditions 
for which mobile broadband is the best monitoring tool and have large 
total addressable markets 
Investing in four key focus areas, which meet this objective: chronic 
disease management, child and maternal health, aging in place, 
and mobile health education 
Reducing barriers to scale: 
− Catalyzing innovative business models to encourage financial 
sustainability 
− Building the evidence base for mHealth interventions 
− Engaging with local and national ministries of health to ensure 
solutions fit with local ICT goals and policy objectives
− Promoting interoperable solutions
