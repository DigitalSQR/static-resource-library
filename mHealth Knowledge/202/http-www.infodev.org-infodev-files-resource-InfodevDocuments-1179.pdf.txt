CONFERENCE
EDITION 2012
With some six billion mobile subscriptions now in use worldwide, about three-quarters of 
Information and Communications  
humanity has access to a mobile phone. Mobiles are arguably the most ubiquitous modern for Development
technology—in some developing countries, more people have access to a mobile phone than 
to clean water, a bank account, or even electricity. And mobile communications now offer major 
opportunities to advance human development—from providing basic access to education or health 
information to making cash payments and stimulating citizen involvement in democratic processes. 
Information and Communications for Development 2012: Maximizing Mobile analyzes the growth and 
evolution of mobile telephony, including the rise of data-based services delivered to handheld 
devices through “apps” (applications) and other ways. Summarizing current thinking and seeking 
to inform the debate on the use of mobile phones to improve livelihoods, the report looks, in par- Maximizing  
ticular, at key ecosystem-based applications in agriculture, health, financial services, employment, 
and government, with chapters devoted to each, and explores the consequences of the emerging 
“app economy” for development. Mobile
The global conversation is no longer about the phone itself, but about how it is used and the content 
and applications that it opens up. These apps and “mash-ups” of services, driven by high-speed 
networks, social networking, online crowdsourcing, and innovation, are helping mobile phones 
transform lives in developed and developing countries alike. They not only benefit individual users, 
they also boost the economy as a whole through cascade effects stimulating growth, entrepreneur-
ship, and productivity. 
Mobile communications promise to do more than just give the developing world a voice—they 
unlock the genie in the phone, empowering people to make their own choices and decisions.
T his report pulls together perspectives from many different stakeholders into a cohesive and com-pelling document on mobile applications for development. It will indeed be a valuable contribu-tion to practitioners, funders, and others who are trying to understand this exciting space.

Box 1.1 Mobile phones and applications
The use of mobile phones has evolved dramatically over time and will continue to do so at an
ever faster pace, so it is important to define some terms that are used throughout this report,
while noting that these definitions are not necessarily stable. Many mobile handsets, particularly
in the developing world are so-called basic phones, based on the second-generation (2G) GSM
(Global System for Mobile communications) standard, first introduced in 1991. GSM offers a
number of different services embedded in the standard and therefore available on all GSM-
compatible devices, however basic. These include short message service (SMS) text messages
of up to 160 characters, and instant messaging using the USSD (Unstructured Supplementary
Service Data) protocol. Many of the older “mobile applications,” particularly in the developing
world, are based on SMS or USSD, because they do not require additional data services or user
downloads and are available on virtually any device. Strictly speaking, however, these should be
considered network services rather than applications (box table 1.1.1). Internet-enabled hand-
sets, or feature phones, were introduced with the launching of data services over mobile
networks in the early 2000s. These phones supported transmission of picture messages and the
downloading of music and often included a built-in camera. Smartphones appeared in the late
2000s. They typically feature graphical interfaces and touchscreen capability, built-in Wi-Fi, and
GPS (global positioning system) capability. 
Smartphones with memories and internet access are also able to download applications,
or “apps,” pieces of software that sit on the phone’s memory and carry out specific functions,

like accessing websites or reporting the phone’s location and status. In this report, the term
“apps” is used to denote such applications that may be downloaded and used on the device,
either with or without a fee, in a stand-alone mode. The most popular apps are games.
More than 30 billion apps had been downloaded as of early 2012 (Gartner 2012; Paul 2012).
Using mobile applications for development usually requires more than simply downloading
an app to a user device, however. Specifically, the most useful mobile applications, such as
those discussed in this report, typically require an ecosystem of content providers (for
instance, reporting price data for agricultural produce, discussed in chapter 2) or agents
(such as those providing cash upload facilities for mobile financial services, discussed in
chapter 4). These kinds of “ecosystem-based mobile applications” are the main topic of
this report. 
However, technological change continues apace. Newer generations of mobile application
may be “cloud based,” in the sense that data is stored by servers on the internet rather than
locally on the device. Applications that use HTML5 (the current generation of hypertext mark-
up language), for instance, may not require any software to be downloaded. Such applications
may have the advantage that they can be used independently of the network or mobile device
that the user is currently using. For instance, a music track stored on the “cloud” might be
accessed from a user’s tablet, smartphone, or PC, and even when the user is roaming
abroad. But such a shift depends on much lower prices, without monthly caps, for mobile
data transmission.

Mobile, a Finnish firm founded in 2003, developed Angry Birds.a
In 2009 Rovio released Angry Birds for the iPhone. The company’s development of Angry
Birds outlines the relationships between game developers, publishers, and giant gaming
companies. Rovio initially worked with publisher Chillingo to develop the iPhone version of
Angry Birds, keeping the rights for versions on other platforms. Following the sale of Chillingo

MDG Example
Poverty and hunger A study on grain traders in Niger found that cell phones improved consumer welfare (Aker 2008). Access to
cell phones allowed traders to obtain better information about grain prices across the country without incur-
ring the high cost of having to travel to different markets. On average grain traders with cell phones had 29
percent higher profits than those without cell phones. In the Niger example, demand sprang up organically
rather than through a specific program. 
Universal education According to a survey of teachers in villages in four African countries, one-quarter reported that the use of
mobile phones helped increase student attendance. A main factor was that teachers could contact parents to
enquire about their child’s whereabouts (Puri et al, n.d.). Mobile phones have also been used in Uganda to
track school attendance so that school administrators can see patterns in attendance, for instance by village,
by day of the week, and by season. Tracking attendance for pupils indirectly also tracks absenteeism among
teachers (Twaweza 2010)
Gender equality A study looking at gender differences in the availability and use of mobile phones in developing countries
reported that 93 percent of the women who had mobiles felt safer because of the phone, 85 percent felt
more independent, and 41 percent had increased income or professional opportunities (GSM Association
2011). The report found that closing the mobile gender gap would increase revenues for mobile operators by
$13 billion.
Child health A program using text messaging to identify malnutrition among rural children in Malawi is notable for its
impact on the speed and quality of the data flows.a Using a system called RapidSMS, health workers in rural
areas were able to transmit weight and height information in two minutes instead of the two months needed
under the previous system. The data entry error rate was significantly improved to just 2.8 percent from 
14.2 percent in the old system. The improved information flow enabled experts to analyze data more quickly
and accurately, identify children at risk, and provide treatment information to the health staff in the field. 
Maternal health One of the earliest uses of mobile technology to improve maternal health took place in rural districts of
Uganda in the late 1990s. Traditional birth attendants were provided walkie-talkies, allowing them to stay in
contact with health centers and obtain advice. An assessment of the program found that it led to roughly a 
50 percent reduction in the maternal mortality rate (Musoke 2002).
HIV/AIDS In Kenya weekly text messages were sent to AIDS patients to remind them to take their antiretroviral drugs
(Lester et al. 2010). Those who received the text messages had significantly higher rates of taking the drugs
than those who did not receive them. The study noted that SMS intervention was less expensive than in-
person community adherence interventions on the basis of travel costs alone and could theoretically translate
into huge health and economic benefits if scaled up.
Environment According to one forecast, mobile technology could lower greenhouse gas emissions 2 percent by the year
2020 (GSM Association 2009). This reduction can be met through, among other things, widespread adoption
of various mobile-enabled technologies such as smart transportation and logistics, smart grids and meters,
smart buildings, and “dematerialization” (replacing the physical movement of goods and services with online
transmission). Mobile phones can also be used as tools for environmental monitoring. In Ghana, for example,
cab drivers in Accra were outfitted with mobile phones with GPS and a tube containing a carbon monoxide
sensor to test pollution levels.b
Partnership? MDG target 8F states: “In cooperation with the private sector, make available benefits of new technologies,
especially information and communications.” Mobile phone penetration in low-income economies has grown
from less than one per 100 people in 2000 to almost one per every three by 2010—largely as a result of private
sector investment. Of some 800 telecom projects in developing countries with private sector participation
between 1990 and 2009, almost three-quarters involved greenfield operations primarily in mobile telephony.c

The graphical user interfaces and touchscreens make them ideal for many developing
nations particularly those with non-western alphabets and sizable illiterate populations.
Smartphone and tablet penetration is rising rapidly in urban areas of developing countries. 
Several initiatives are under way that feature low-cost tablets and investigate the feasibility
of devices for rural areas: 
• In Bangladesh, the Digits to All (DTA) project distributed custom developed tablets (see
screenshot) to over 100 households in a rural village to test their feasibility. The $100
Amadeyr tablet uses the Android operating system with software specifically designed
and customized for use by semiliterate, illiterate, and bottom-of-the-pyramid users. The
tablet uses a touchscreen operated by seeing pictures and hearing instructions given in
Bengali, making it user-friendly for illiterate villagers. The project found that villagers who
had never used PCs, let alone the internet, were able to use the tablets within a few
days and noted: "It is not the rural population who needs to be trained to have access to
information but it is the next generation communication technologies that can be
tailored to meet the local needs and be made easily accessible by rural communities"
(Quadri et al. 2011).
• India launched its locally manufactured Aakash tablet in October 2011(Tuli 2011). Priced at
around $35 the tablet is aimed for widespread distribution in schools. Apart from its low cost,
the Aakash tablet has other features suitable for the Indian environment including data
compression techniques that lower consumption and hence reduce Internet access charges.
One of the organizations involved in the project forecasts that some 5 million of the tablets
will be shipped in 2012, around half of the equivalent PC figure.

Box 1.3 (continued)
• A project in Tanzania has been familiarizing farmers with smartphones to introduce them to
the features and potential uses (Banks 2011). Although most farmers already had cell
phones, they had never used the internet. The smartphones have been used for geotagging
climate information and to make videos of farmers offering advice on techniques. The infor-
mation is uploaded to the internet to share with other farmers. The visually oriented infor-
mation helped one maize grower to learn from planting mistakes and a few months later he
had his first successful harvest. 
Governments, the private sector, academia, and the development community all have a role
to play in promoting smartphones and tablets for development. Governments in particular can
be encouraged by the potential of these devices to take ICT for development to another level
through easy-to-use graphical interfaces with Internet connectivity over wireless networks.
Just as the One Laptop per Child program helped trigger a reduction in low-end computers, a

Box 2.1 How Reuters Market Light generates hyperlocalized information 
An international news giant launched Reuters Market Light (RML) in 2007 to provide market
prices and weather and crop advisory services to farmers in India. Invented by a Reuters
employee, this service offers highly customizable market information to farmers through text
messages delivered to mobile phones. 
To subscribe, farmers call a toll-free number to activate the service in the local language and
specify the crops and markets in which they have an interest. Farmers receive four to five SMS
alerts with relevant information each day. Initial studies show that farmers who receive the
service typically gain 5–10 percent more income. 
RML is one of India’s largest market information services, serving 250,000 customers
across tens of thousands of villages. It delivers customized information to India’s farming
sector covering over 250 crops, 1,000 markets, and 3,000 weather locations across 13 Indian
states in 8 local languages. 
The company employs over 300 office staff in eight states to process localized agricultural
information. The teams, organized according to content type, scour media sources for agricul-
tural news (including market prices, pest and disease reports, government programs, weather
reports, and local news). This information is sorted by geography and sent to the appropriate
subscribers. RML’s growth shows that embracing a wide network of people—including, in this
case, price collectors, agricultural institutes, and other information providers—is a vital success
factor for mobile applications ecosystems. 
Such detailed processing can involve large sunk costs with relatively high monthly operat-
ing costs of $4 a customer. There is a trade-off between the provision of local information and
scalability. Local teams are needed to collect data, and expansion into new areas may involve
additional content provision costs, limiting economies of scale. Costs therefore climb in paral-
lel with new subscribers. Because it relies solely on income from this single service, RML’s
market remains relatively small and is not yet profitable.
RML has sought to reach as many customers as possible through a number of strategies,
including sales offices in postal offices, local shops, input suppliers, and banks. Customers
obtain RML through basic SMS using prepaid scratch cards that give access to the service for
a given amount of time. 
RML competes with traditional information services (radio, market intermediaries, news-
papers) and other services that use mobile phones. IFFCO Kisan Sanchar Limited (IKSL) offers
similar market information for rural farmers but uses voice messages so illiterate farmers can
use the service. Achieving economies of scale is essential for profitability. In 2009 RML report-
edly crossed the $1 million sales mark.

Box 2.2 A pregnant pause for Sri Lanka’s cows
The Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) of Sri Lanka discovered that

pregnant at any given time, resulting in a loss of 30–35 days’ worth of milk. Low pregnancy
rates resulted from a lack of timely access to artificial insemination and breeding services. The

request is then sent to all registered suppliers, so they can contact the farmers directly. Farm-

service. According to Sri Lanka’s Department of Dairy Foods, milk production could be
increased by 30 percent if artificial insemination services were requested and supplied in a
timely manner. Moreover, the ICTA estimates that farmers could earn an additional $262 per

Box 2.3 Tracking specialty coffee
Lack of traceability during the growing and procurement process is a major constraint for
producers growing for high-value export markets, such as specialty coffee. For the coopera-
tives and companies that manage the exports, emerging mobile technology—smartphones
and tablets—can play a major role in capturing, tracking, and accessing valuable information
from growing practices to crop quality.
Sustainable Harvest is a coffee importer that works with 200,000 farmers in Latin America
and East Africa. Extending its relationship-based procurement model to the digital platform,
the organization and its farmer training offices have introduced a new coffee traceability
program—called the Relationship Information Tracking System, or RITS—to help coffee grow-
ers become more efficient, reliable, and quality-focused through a new mobile or tablet-based
information tracking system. 
RITS provides farmer cooperatives with the ability to trace each step of the value chain.
Using a cloud-based application, the cooperative managers can record deliveries of coffee from
each member including details of coffee varieties and quality scores for each lot of coffee
received. The application also tracks the certification status of each delivery, processes farmer
payment, and generates reports on farmer productivity, payments, and samples.
Roaster clients can access videos, photos, quality, and lot information from their supplier
cooperatives. The application has been designed for Apple’s iPad and iPhone, but it can be
used in any smartphone through the web browser. Devices with large touchscreens allow for
easier input of a large variety of information. The application can record information offline, and
then upload to the online database when connectivity is restored.
In 2011 Sustainable Harvest also launched RITS Ed, an iPad app that delivers agricultural
training videos on organic coffee production and quality control that co-op managers can use
to assist their members. Sustainable Harvest also plans to expedite the application process for
third-party certification (organic, for example) through the launch of a new module, RITS
Metrics, that will enable more robust, and customizable reports. 
RITS is currently testing the program with two cooperatives in Peru with 500 members and
one cooperative in East Africa with 1,840 members.

DrumNet project is an integrated platform that uses various ICTs, including mobile phones, to
provide producers, traders, and financial service providers with an end-to-end solution to
procuring inputs, linking to buyers, and finalizing credit and payments. 
Starting with fast-growing horticulture and oilseed industries in Kenya, DrumNet ran a
series of pilots that delivered services to agro-buyers, banks, farm input retailers, and farmers.
The pilots were implemented in five different Kenyan provinces and are reported to have
involved over 4,000 small-scale farmers. 
Before farmers plant crops, DrumNet’s network of entrepreneurs negotiates contractual
arrangements between buyers and farmers. These agreements allow farmers to access credit

from partner institutions such as Equity Bank and to purchase inputs from certified retailers.
At harvest, DrumNet franchise representatives coordinate produce aggregation, grading, and
transportation through agreements with local field agents and transporters. DrumNet tracks
and facilitates the entire process through the use of complimentary manual and SMS
applications. 
Benefits to the stakeholders include:
• Farmers reduce transaction costs by accessing both credit and markets through DrumNet
and are able to pay off their loans with their farm produce proceeds. Farmer income is
reported to have risen by an average of 32 percent.
• Large-scale buyers are freed from the requirement of managing cumbersome transactions
to ensure reliable supplies of produce from multiple smallholders.
• Input sellers can access new customers without having to sell products on credit.
• Banks and microfinancial institutions are able to tap into a currently inaccessible market for
savings and credit while avoiding high transaction costs.
The process creates an enabling environment for agricultural finance in a number of ways:
• Banks are assured at the time of lending that farmers have a market for their produce and
the means to adequately serve that market, which indicates a healthy revenue stream.
• Banks offer in-kind credit to farmers for inputs. 
• Cashless payment transfers reduce strategic default, since farmers cannot obtain revenue
until their outstanding loans are fully paid.
The DrumNet project employs tested value-chain approaches to promote agricultural lend-
ing. Its operating cost of about $6.80 a user is high, and DrumNet is facing difficulties because
it has not yet reached a critical mass that would allow it to stand alone without donor funding.
Farmers’ inability to attain sufficient crop yields, because of irregular and insufficient rain and
other factors, has also threatened the success of the project.

of the mPesa mobile payment ecosystem,
based on local application developers, projects
mounted by local nongovernmental organiza-
tions (NGOs), favorable governmental policies,
foreign investment, and stable economic condi-
tions. This active ecosystem has benefited the
health sector, with many mHealth applications
being piloted in Kenya.
Unfortunately, the proliferation of pilot
programs, with diverse goals and stakehold-
ers, has fragmented the Kenyan mHealth
landscape: standardized platforms that are
well-integrated with the local health care
system are lacking; few projects have been
endowed with long-term funding; and
systematic evaluation and impact studies are
scarce. 
Only recently have more streamlined
coordination and division of responsibilities
started to emerge. Increasingly, the govern-
ment is taking over mHealth implementation
and ensuring that it complements national
policy, while NGOs undertake research,
monitoring, and evaluation. Kenya certainly
offers an insightful repertoire of mHealth
applications. 
A recent notable effort is MEDAfrica.org, a company launched in November 2011 that is currently
being incubated in the infoDev mobile applications lab in Nairobi (see chapter 5). The application inte-
grates symptom checkers, first-aid information, doctor and hospital directories, and alert services into
a single, customizable mobile information platform (see screenshot in this box). MEDAfrica won the
East African application contest Pivot 25.
MEDAfrica is also pioneering a viable business model, which has attracted worldwide
media and investor attention. Other Kenyan mHealth applications are based on remote moni-
toring or supply chain management through simple SMS technology. Examples include
systems for HIV medication reminders, children’s health monitoring, early-infant HIV diagnosis,
and medicine validation through scratch codes.

Box 3.2 Ethiopia: SMS helps in monitoring UNICEF’s food supply chain
Box figure 3.2.1 RapidSMS in Ethiopia
Ethiopia faces significant challenges to effective performance in its health sector. The country
is struggling to reduce maternal and child mortality, preventable communicable diseases, and
malnutrition. While some policy initiatives have achieved notable success, Ethiopia is likely to
meet only one of the six health-related targets under the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) by 2015. Health care coordination, monitoring, and supply chain management are
largely deficient. Funding is limited and well-trained health staff scarce.
In 2008 Ethiopia was hit by severe droughts, leading UNICEF to administer a large-scale
food distribution program. Because of the country’s poor telecommunication infrastructure
and low technical literacy, however, inventory management at local distribution centers was
arduous: teams of monitors had to travel back and forth to the centers to deliver hand-
written reports of inventory. Inventory analysis could be started only after the data had been
delivered, which often took several weeks. In response, UNICEF worked with RapidSMS,
which helped cut delays in data transmission related to paper-based collection. Transmission
times were reduced from about two months to approximately two minutes. Additionally,
data quality discrepancies decreased from 14.2 percent to 2.8 percent while generating
significant cost savings. In developing RapidSMS, UNICEF has shown that mHealth applica-
tions can represent a feasible low-tech response to challenging conditions such as those in
Ethiopia.
RapidSMS was designed to be a simple supply chain management tool, which auto-
matically integrates inventory information sent by SMS into a central database in real time.
SMS technology is easily accessible and robust, and minimal training is needed to use the
application. RapidSMS allows for stock taking, new admissions, precise location of distri-
bution centers, and analysis of the quantities of food distributed and consumed. This analy-
sis was sped up by immediate visualizations in graphs and maps, accessible by offices in
all locations. Monitors still have to travel to distribution centers, but from there they can
immediately send stock information to the server. Saving days in travel literally saves lives:
UNICEF can respond to shortages and deliver new food resources more promptly, rapidly,
and efficiently.
The RapidSMS system is a success story, but several issues arose, including a lack of
standards for coding distribution centers, poor allocation of responsibilities, and slow reso-
lution of technical issues. This experience underlines the need for ICT systems to be inte-
grated into existing health care systems as well as the need for capacity building to use ICT
effectively.

Box 3.3 India: Health Management and Research Institute—104 Mobile
India’s Health Management and Research Institute (HMRI) is a public-private partnership
between the state government of Andhra Pradesh (which bears 95 percent of costs) and the
Satyam Foundation (which bears 5 percent of costs) based in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh.
HMRI launched “104 Mobile” in 2008a to improve local health services by replacing the tradi-
tional health care system with mHealth applications for disease surveillance, prevention coun-
seling, telemedicine, and supply chain management. 
104 Mobile sends medical units (MUs) to habitations more than three kilometers away from
the nearest public health service provider to provide medical care to rural populations. Each
MU circulates on a fixed date every month, ensuring continuity of care. Maternal and child
health are prioritized, along with the diagnosis and management of chronic diseases such as
diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and epilepsy. 104 Mobile deployed 475 MUs to 22 districts
throughout Andhra Pradesh. Generally, treatments at clinics tend to be costly, and more than
half of unmet requests for outpatient care could be treated by phone in rural areas—a poten-
tial that 104 Mobile can exploit through its hotline for medical consultations. 
HMRI has delivered the following major benefits (partly thanks to the integration of
mHealth applications): 
• Expanded the service area covered by 25 percent
• Services may cost as little as one-tenth of those provided by the government 
• Up to 55 percent of 600,000 unmet requests for outpatient treatment could be treated by phone
• 1.26 million pregnant women each received an average of three antenatal care check-ups 
• 2.9 million people with chronic diseases were screened, tested, and provided with medication 
• Over 10 million unique electronic health records were established, making this one of the
largest public electronic health record databases worldwide

Box 4.1 One device, many channels
Mobile phones are multifunctional devices that allow for a variety of communication methods.
These range from ubiquitous voice and SMS channels to more sophisticated means such as soft-
ware applications or web browsers. To be a viable solution for mobile money, the channel should
ideally be universally available (including the cheapest mobile phones) and must be secure. In
practice, this requirement largely limits mobile money to using a standard network service, such
as USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) or SMS (short message system), or an

Box 4.2 Using mobile money
Mobile money applications are typically small pieces of software embedded on a SIM card or
available over a mobile network. A customer can use an inexpensive mobile to send value to
someone else. To change this digital value into cash, a user simply visits a retail agent who
verifies the user’s identity and makes the switch. In this way, money can cross enormous
distances at the speed of a text message. Consider a young Tanzanian who has moved to Dar
es Salaam to find work. With mobile money, he can send regular, small payments to his family
at their rural home without needing to pay and trust a courier or take it himself. His family can

Box 4.3 Business models for mobile money
Although it has received both direct and indirect support from the public sector, to date, mobile
money remains a private sector enterprise. To achieve profitability, mobile money providers
have pioneered three general business models: mobile-operator-led, bank-led, and collabora-
tive. Because operators control the mobile platform and have significant distribution capacity
through their existing retail agent networks, it is logical that mobile money deployments will
often be initiated by operators who may partner or collaborate with a bank. In some places,
such as Pakistan, where the operator Telenor purchased a 51 percent stake in Tameer Microfi-
nance Bank, the boundaries between the two entities may be blurred.
A variety of business models exist for mobile money. Although M-PESA popularized a
model based primarily on peer-to-peer transfers, mobile money systems elsewhere are quite
different. For example, in South Africa, WIZZIT is an independent mobile money provider that
works over all mobile networks and that has partnered with banks to provide customers with
easily accessible accounts. In Thailand, the two relatively successful mobile money operations
have partnered with retailers from the start and emphasize bill payment offerings. 
According to the International Finance Corporation’s Mobile Money Study, in a given
market, the business case for mobile money will be driven by those players with the strongest
incentive to develop mobile money; the primary value proposition for targeted customers; and
the regulation, demand, and partnership requirements. Combining these variables, the Inter-
national Finance Corporation has developed mobile money demand curves that show how
mobile money has different appeal in different environments.

The black curve represents mobile money demand for developing economies. As develop-
ing countries progress, financial infrastructure develops, and competition from banks, credit
card companies, and other financial institutions increases. The black curve becomes dotted
because demand changes from low-cost, low-speed, and infrequent to high-speed and high-
volume as represented by the blue curve. The green curve starts off dotted because developed
countries already have substantial financial infrastructure, thus demand for low-cost, low-
speed, infrequent transactions is low. The continuum is divided into three parts: alternative
infrastructure, transition phase, and collaboration. In developing economies mobile money acts
as an alternative infrastructure to existing financial services; during the transition phase mobile
money moves from an alternative infrastructure to a complementary one. In the collaboration
phase mobile money must fully integrate with the financial infrastructure.

Box 4.4 Interoperability and innovation in mobile money
The excitement surrounding successful mobile money deployments has spurred significant
additional innovative activity. Surveying the landscape in Kenya, Kendall et al. (2011) found that
M-PESA has emerged as a platform for a wide variety of new applications and services. Busi-
nesses have started integrating M-PESA into their activities, often to improve efficiencies and
reduce costs. Other entrepreneurial ventures offer entirely new services based on the mobile
phone, such as a medical savings plan from Changamka Microhealth Ltd. Finally, an entirely
new category of businesses is developing; these businesses serve as intermediary bridge-
builders, allowing others to integrate with mobile money. For example, Kopo Kopo is a start-
up that offers smaller financial institutions and competing mobile money providers the
technical means to integrate with M-PESA.
There is reason to worry that this initial flourishing is tenuous. The lack of seamless inter-
operability (for example, through an M-PESA application programming interface) is a common
complaint, raising the costs of working with M-PESA. Because it is a proprietary service of
Vodafone, the businesses building on top of the platform are highly dependent upon the

network of five mobile application labs, or mLabs, and eight mobile social networking hubs,
or mHubs. In Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Uganda,
Nepal, Pakistan, and Vietnam, mLabs and mHubs facilitate demand-driven innovation by
grassroots entrepreneurs, so breakthrough low-cost, high-value applications can be devel-
oped. Each mLab is a technology-neutral physical space with testing facilities for developing
the technical skills and business sense needed to build scalable mobile solutions into thriving
businesses that address social needs. As well as providing state-of-the-art equipment, the
labs offer technical training and workshops, and they connect developers and entrepreneurs
with potential investors, experts, and public sector leaders. The labs are complemented by
eight mHubs, which focus on bringing together various stakeholder communities in the
mobile industry and providing advice, mentorship, idea and product development competi-
tions, and access to investors through regular informal events and conferences. Both the
mLabs and mHubs are run and used by local communities working to increase the competi-
tiveness of enterprises in mobile content and applications and are part of a wider mobile inno-
vation program, seeking to develop talent and produce successful companies with strong
growth potential.

Founded in 2005 by graduate fellows at Harvard University, MIT, and the Arab-American
University of Jenin (West Bank and Gaza), Souktel launched a trial service in 2007. Within a
year, over 100 of the 400 new college graduates who participated in the pilot found work or
internships, and more than three-fifths of employers who used this service cut their recruiting
time and costs by up to half. With a $100,000 grant from the World Bank Group, the service
has been launched at three more college campuses in partnership with the Ministry of Educa-
tion, then franchised in Morocco, Somalia, and the United Arab Emirates; and it is expected to
launch in the Arab Republic of Egypt and Rwanda.
Leveraging the high penetration rate of mobile phones, Souktel developed a job information
software platform to connect job seekers with employers via a mobile device. One of the
unique characteristics of Souktel is its franchise business model. Souktel has used this model
to achieve a rapid growth in new markets. Each country uses a customized version of the
JobMatch platform for a franchise fee and a recurrent annual support fee. In return, per-use
revenue from local user fees charged to job seekers and employers accrue to the franchisee,
helping to ensure each franchise’s long-term cost coverage and sustainability. 
As a way of measuring its impact, Souktel uses weekly database tracking of service use
(searches, match requests, job alerts); monthly phone surveys of “matched” job seekers and
employers; and bi-annual “match retention” phone surveys and institutional partner surveys.
Positive outcomes are observed in the reduction of time spent looking for employment (from
an average of 12 weeks to 1 week or less), wage increases (64 percent of matched job seek-
ers in the West Bank and Palestine surveyed in 2009 reported a 50 percent increase in aver-
age monthly wages, from $500 a month to $750 a month), and a reduction in hiring costs and
time (70 percent of West Bank and Gaza employers surveyed in 2009 reported a 50 percent
reduction in hiring costs and time, while 75 percent of the same sample confirmed a mean
5 percent increase in annual profits). Challenges have included working with the different
mobile carriers. The cost of SMS, which averages about $0.05 a message in the West Bank
and Gaza, is also a barrier to wider usage.

Box 6.1 The mobile telephone as a tool for citizen voice and 
empowerment
Mobile devices, especially mobile telephones, have become important tools for citizens to
express their opinions, mobilize groups, and report on events as they unfold (UNDP 2012).
Although mobile telephones and associated applications cannot substitute for community
mobilization and democratic processes, they can and have played a role in organizing citizens,
especially through social media such as Facebook and Twitter (Brisson and Krontiris 2012).
Perhaps the best-known example is the Ushahidi platform, which emerged in Kenya in
response to the violence that erupted after the 2007 election. Ushahidi has now become an

Box 6.2 Kerala’s mobile government program
The southern Indian state of Kerala has a population of 33 million. Leveraging the wide use
of mobile telephones, the Kerala State IT Mission (KSITM) leads a province-level mGovern-
ment program. The objective was to allow equitable access and enable social impact by
reaching people with mobile devices, rather than only those who are able to afford and access
computer-based internet services.
The centerpiece in Kerala’s m-Government architecture is a common service delivery plat-
form (SDP) that integrates various channels such as voice, data, and SMS. The KSITM manages
the SDP, supervising a private firm, MobMe, which set up the SDP. All government departments
can access the SDP to enable the cost-effective design, development, and deployment of vari-
ous mGovernment applications. This arrangement avoids duplication of effort and cuts capital
spending on stand-alone systems. By integrating with all telecommunication companies, the
SDP eliminates the need for individual coordination by government agencies. The KSITM also
provides technical assistance to public departments to design and launch mobile applications.
Services include a common “short code” for the government (citizens dial KERALA or
537252 to access services). The service has created an additional incentive for the government
to offer services relevant to consumers, including citizen voting on a social reality show where
village governments present their successes, posting scores for major exams, and processing
movie and bus ticket reservations. The KSITM has also set up an electronic SMS (eSMS) gate-
way for various government departments to communicate throughout their own units and
departments and across institutions. An interactive voice response system supports govern-
ment customer service call centers and was used to conduct an energy availability survey. A
Mobile Crime and Accident Reporting Platform has been used by Keralan police to enhance
public safety and law and order. Now, the state is looking to adopt a mobile payments plat-
form, so citizens can pay government fees from their handsets. The state continues to improve
and scale up initial mobile applications, such as multimedia messaging service-based accident
and crime reporting.
Since its launch in December 2010, the program has involved more than 60 government
agencies, facilitated more than 3 million interactions between the government and citizens,
deployed at least 20 mGovernment applications, and captured some 200,000 photos for crime
and accident reporting purposes. As the KSITM sees it, this is a start to shifting government-
citizen interactions from “red tape” to a “red carpet.”
Yet, the state faces various challenges in using mobile technology to create transformative
change. Successful applications for citizen participatory monitoring and reporting remain elusive.
Other key challenges are the low resource and process capacity of public agencies, which limit
the ability of the state to respond or improve its accountability.

Box 6.3 Evolving toward coordination: the case of the Republic of Korea
By 2011 government agencies in the Republic of Korea had launched more than 160 mobile
applications covering internal processes, access to information, and public service delivery.
Problems soon emerged, however, because the applications lacked a common framework. As
a result, there was a redundant development of products, mismatch of technical standards
across ministries and agencies, and the lack of a clear direction for budget priorities around
mGovernment services. 
To address these challenges, the government in 2011 launched a five-year, $55 million strat-
egy to integrate mGovernment, focusing on both internal processes and public services. This
strategy establishes a common framework for developing simple mobile websites, hybrid
websites customizable by operating system, and mobile applications. For each of the five years,
the strategy sets priorities ranging from security to quality assurance and authentication, to the
establishment of a mobile common data management system. It also provides a detailed guide
to the user interfaces and experiences with mobile government websites.

Box 6.4 Open data and mobile access in Kenya
Governments are beginning to open public data sets and make them accessible to the public
and civil society. With mobile telephones being more widespread than PCs, it is not surpris-
ing to see more open data being made available on mobile platforms with interesting conse-
quences.
In July 2011 Kenya became one of the first African countries to launch an open data
initiative, making some 160 government datasets open to the public, with more on the
way (www.opendata.go.ke). The aim was to lead to a more responsive and citizen
focused-government. Among the initial data sets that were uploaded are poverty surveys
by district, budget by government department, and plans for future changes in electoral
districts and health facilities. A beta site was launched in June 2009 and the public site a
year later. 
But in Kenya, as in many other developing nations, mobile ownership far exceeds PC owner-
ship, so to increase transparency and widen access, facilitating mobile access to the data is an
important goal. Kenya’s experience with Ushahidi (see box 6.1) created a local precedent for this.
To support the development of mobile applications that would open up the government data, the

Box 6.5 Challenges to trust and credibility
As governments find more ways to deliver services using mobile and geo-location technolo-
gies, concerns over security and privacy are mounting. If used properly, mGovernment can
promote transparency and accountability of service delivery. However, citizens often express
concern about the security of their private and confidential information, possible surveillance,
and anonymity, among other issues.
It is vital that governments create a legal and technical framework to protect data from
corruption or leakage. Without strong protection or the quick resolution of any breach, citizens
will be wary of sharing their information with the government, and efforts to connect and inter-
act would quickly be undermined. Internet users already face security problems—for example,
so-called “Trojans” or “malware” can compromise personal computers and gather private data
from users illegally.
While location- and context-based services offer powerful opportunities, illegal or unwar-
ranted surveillance must also be avoided. Again, citizens need to be assured that installing
applications or using services will not compromise their privacy. Governments will need to
exercise care in securing their systems and software to avoid any perception of surveillance.
For example, the Data Protection Working Party, an independent European Union advisory
body on data protection and privacy, has suggested that users of smartphones and other
mobile devices give clear and explicit consent and have a clear understanding of how the data
will be used, before location data is collected.
Finally, citizens might seek anonymity (or pseudonymity) as they become more vocal to
avoid the risk of reprisals due to their views. Governments may need to consider which ser-
vices require identification and which services (anticorruption hotlines, for example) might be
more popular if citizens can remain anonymous when they make a report.
Balancing privacy concerns against the government’s need to ensure that it is dealing with
legitimate users of the service should not be a barrier to exploring mGovernment. Rather, it
should be the catalyst for ongoing conversations regarding the strength of privacy laws and
proper auditing alongside the ability to share information.

Box 7.1 Using reverse auctions to match spectrum allocations with
coverage obligations in Chile
In Chile, the government provided spectrum in multiple bands for mobile broadband in
underserved rural areas. Chile offered subsidies through a reverse auction (resulting in a
government subsidy of more than $100 million) to develop mobile broadband in around
1,500 municipalities in rural areas, where no broadband service was available. Extending
coverage to these areas could mean that 90 percent of Chile’s population would have broad-
band coverage. Minimum service conditions for broadband access (such as a 1 Mbit/sdown-
link) and a ceiling on prices was established. The winner of the auction, Entel Movil, started
deploying mobile broadband in these areas in September 2010.a The large expansion of
mobile broadband services in the country, has permitted Entel Movil to achieve the largest
share of mobile broadband connections in the country, surpassing its other two main
competitors (figure 7.1.1).

Box A.1 Mobile use in rural China
An ongoing World Bank project has been investigating attitudes, use, and impact of informa-
tion and communication technologies in rural China. Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, one of the activities was a survey in rural areas of three provinces (Jilin, Guizhou,
and Shandong). Some 58 percent of the population in these provinces is rural; the combined
rural population is 88 million, which would make the three provinces the 13th largest country
in the world (about the size of Vietnam). The survey, carried out in October 2011, found very
high use of mobiles, with 95 percent of rural households reporting having one. Individual
ownership was lower at 85 percent, but over half of individuals without their own mobile
reported they did not have one because they could use someone else’s or they had no need.
Around half of mobile phone owners reported sending text messages, and some 13 percent
use the internet from their cell phone. One interesting finding was the relatively large amount
spent on mobile services. Average monthly mobile phone service expenditure was 13 percent
of income, with users willing to devote up to 18 percent of their income to mobile services.

CONFERENCE
EDITION 2012
With some six billion mobile subscriptions now in use worldwide, about three-quarters of 
Information and Communications  
humanity has access to a mobile phone. Mobiles are arguably the most ubiquitous modern for Development
technology—in some developing countries, more people have access to a mobile phone than 
to clean water, a bank account, or even electricity. And mobile communications now offer major 
opportunities to advance human development—from providing basic access to education or health 
information to making cash payments and stimulating citizen involvement in democratic processes. 
Information and Communications for Development 2012: Maximizing Mobile analyzes the growth and 
evolution of mobile telephony, including the rise of data-based services delivered to handheld 
devices through “apps” (applications) and other ways. Summarizing current thinking and seeking 
to inform the debate on the use of mobile phones to improve livelihoods, the report looks, in par- Maximizing  
ticular, at key ecosystem-based applications in agriculture, health, financial services, employment, 
and government, with chapters devoted to each, and explores the consequences of the emerging 
“app economy” for development. Mobile
The global conversation is no longer about the phone itself, but about how it is used and the content 
and applications that it opens up. These apps and “mash-ups” of services, driven by high-speed 
networks, social networking, online crowdsourcing, and innovation, are helping mobile phones 
transform lives in developed and developing countries alike. They not only benefit individual users, 
they also boost the economy as a whole through cascade effects stimulating growth, entrepreneur-
ship, and productivity. 
Mobile communications promise to do more than just give the developing world a voice—they 
unlock the genie in the phone, empowering people to make their own choices and decisions.
T his report pulls together perspectives from many different stakeholders into a cohesive and com-pelling document on mobile applications for development. It will indeed be a valuable contribu-tion to practitioners, funders, and others who are trying to understand this exciting space.
