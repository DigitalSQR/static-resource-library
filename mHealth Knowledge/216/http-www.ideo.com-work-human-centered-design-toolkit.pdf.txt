Design	Kit:	The	Human-Centered	Design
Toolkit
The	kit	includes	from-the-field	case	studies	of	human-centered	design	in	action.
In	2009,	IDEO	designed	and	launched	the	HCD	Toolkit,	a	first-of-its-kind	book	that	laid	out	how	and
why	human-centered	design	can	impact	the	social	sector.	In	short	order,	a	community	of	designers,
entrepreneurs,	and	social	sector	innovators	embraced	it,	buying	and	downloading	over	150,000	copies.
In	April	2015,	IDEO.org	launched	an	exciting	new	evolution	of	the	HCD	Toolkit	the	Field	Guide	to
Human-Centered	Design.	The	Field	Guide	is	the	latest	in	IDEO.org’s	suite	of	teaching	tools	and	a	step
forward	in	sharing	the	practice	and	promise	of	human-centered	design	with	the	social	sector.
A	full-color,	192-page	book,	the	Field	Guide	comes	with	57	design	methods,	the	key	mindsets	that
underpin	how	and	why	IDEO.org	believes	design	can	change	lives,	a	full	slate	of	worksheets,	and	case
studies	from	projects	that	show	human-centered	design	in	action.
The	Field	Guide	was	funded	by	more	than	1300	backers	in	a	Kickstarter	campaign	that	reaching	nearly
three	times	its	initial	goal.	IDEO.org	received	an	amazing	outpouring	of	support	and	strengthened	its
deeply	held	belief	that	human-centered	design	can	push	the	social	sector	forward.
IDEO.org	is	a	nonprofit	design	organization	that	launched	out	of	IDEO	in	2011	with	a	mission	to
improve	the	lives	of	poor	and	vulnerable	communities	through	design.
