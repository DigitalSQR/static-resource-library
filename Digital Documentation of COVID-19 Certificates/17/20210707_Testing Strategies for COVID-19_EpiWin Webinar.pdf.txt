An update on
Testing strategies for COVID-19
THE LATEST ON THE COVID-19 GLOBAL SITUATION
& HOW TO USE TESTING TO ACHIEVE PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES
Testing should be linked to public health goals
• COVID-19 testing is part of a 
comprehensive strategy to:
➢ Suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission 
➢ Prevent severe disease and reduce You cannot fight a fire 
mortality blindfolded. And we 
Protect the health system cannot stop this ➢
pandemic if we don’t 
• Testing should be linked to public health know who is infected.
actions such as:
➢ Clinical care
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus
➢ Isolation of confirmed cases Director-General, World Health Organization
16 March 2020
➢ Contact tracing
➢ Supported quarantine of contacts
➢ Providing information to the person 
being tested
2
Developing WHO guidance on testing strategies
• WHO draws upon internal expertise across all 3 levels of the 
organization – HQ, regional and country offices, and leverages the 
different levels to engage stakeholders:
➢ Convening and coordinating partners, expert groups and Member States
➢ Enhancing information sharing among and from MS such as challenges and 
lessons learnt
• WHO draws upon external expertise through its reference laboratory 
networks, members of the ACT-Accelerator, including civil society, and 
open forums including global consultations
• WHO closely monitors literature for updates and scientific 
developments
• A Guideline Development Group is being established, according to 
WHO procedures: https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/145714 to 
prioritize evidence reviews pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and 
diagnostic testing strategies.
➢ Will include membership of civil society

Individual factors can contribute to SARS-CoV-2 transmission
• People infected with SARS-CoV-2 can transmit 
virus with or without symptoms
• Most infected people transmit the virus 
around 2 days before they develop symptoms 
and up to 9-10 days after symptom onset
• People who develop severe disease can be 
infectious for longer
• Immunocompromised people can shed the 
virus for months
• Symptomatic persons infected with SARS-
CoV-2 are 3 to 18 times more likely to 
transmit the virus than asymptomatic 
persons*

COVID-19 testing strategies depend on the transmission scenario
Four different scenarios
1 2 3 4
No reported Sporadic Cluster Community 
cases cases of cases transmission*
*Countries can experience one or more of these scenarios at the same time in different places

7
Testing strategy when there are no cases
Transmission scenario “No cases”: no reported cases
No Testing strategy scenario 1:
cases
• Aim to: Detect imported cases early to prevent 
clusters
• Use a RT-PCR* test to confirm the first cases**
• Be vigilant, maintain testing capacity at a 
minimum, but surge capacity as a precaution
• Ensure robust surveillance activities continue
Scenario 1
** https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/diagnostic-testing-for-sars-cov-2
*RT-PCR or Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) is the reference test
https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-lab-testing-2021.1-eng
8
Testing strategy when there are sporadic cases
Transmission scenario “Sporadic cases”: cases detected in the last 14 days are imported, sporadic 
or linked to imported/sporadic cases and there are no clear signals of further transmission*
Sporadic cases Testing strategy scenario 2:
• Aim to: Prevent onward SARS-CoV-2 transmission through 
case finding:
➢ Test symptomatic persons and asymptomatic 
contacts of confirmed or probable cases
➢ Treat and isolate persons with confirmed or 
probable SARS-CoV-2 infection 
➢ Trace contacts of confirmed or probable cases
• Use a RT-PCR* test**
Scenario 2
** https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/diagnostic-testing-for-sars-cov-2 *RT-PCR or Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) is the reference test
https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-lab-testing-2021.1-eng
9
Testing strategy when there are clusters of cases
Transmission Scenario “Clusters of cases”: cases detected in the last 14 days are predominantly 
limited to well-defined clusters
Clusters of cases Testing strategy scenario 3
• Aim to: Prevent onward SARS-CoV-2 transmission through 
case finding:
➢ Test symptomatic persons and asymptomatic contacts 
of confirmed cases
➢ Treat and isolate persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 
infection 
➢ Trace contacts of symptomatic persons
• Important to carry out outbreak  and cluster investigations
➢ Confirm suspected outbreaks of COVID-19 among 
symptomatic persons
Scenario 3 • Use a RT-PCR test when available*

https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-lab-testing-2021.1-eng
10
Testing strategy when there is community transmission
Transmission scenario “Community transmission”: high incidence of locally acquired, widely dispersed cases in 
the past 14 days
Testing strategy scenario 4:
• Aim to: Prevent onward SARS-CoV-2 transmission as much as possible through case 
Community finding:
transmission
➢ Test symptomatic persons 
➢ Test asymptomatic contacts of confirmed or probable cases if capacity allows
➢ Treat and isolate persons with confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection 
➢ Trace contacts of symptomatic persons* 
• Important to carry out outbreak investigations, especially in vulnerable groups or in 
areas where there can be superspreading events
➢ Confirm suspected outbreaks of COVID-19 among symptomatic persons
• If there is limited testing capacity, prioritize testing of suspected COVID-19 cases who 
are: 
➢ Persons at risk of developing severe disease
➢ Health workers
➢ Inpatients in health facilities
➢ in a closed settings such as a school, prison or long-term living facility
Scenario 4
• Use a RT-PCR test or an antigen rapid diagnostic test (RDT)*
* In settings of widespread community transmission, an Ag-RDT can be used
11
SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests 
• Countries need to test for SARS-CoV-2 
according to the national strategy, 
using available and approved 
diagnostic tests
• WHO recommends testing of all SARS-
CoV-2 suspected cases
• More information on diagnostic 
testing can be found here:

How should testing be prioritized ? 
• WHO recommends that all individuals 
who are suspected to be infected with 
SARS-CoV-2 be tested with NAAT or Ag- Suspected COVID-19
RDT, regardless of vaccination status or 
COVID-19 disease history
• Asymptomatic individuals should be 
tested with NAAT or Ag-RDT if they are at 
higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and if Asymptomatic: contacts of 
confirmed cases and health 
resources are available to test them
and care workers
• Individuals at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 
infection include:
➢ Contacts of confirmed or probable cases
➢ People who are frequently exposed No known
through their occupation, such as health exposure 
and care workers or long-term care 
facility workers who are providing care 
to COVID-19 patients
13
How should testing be prioritized?
• In some countries or settings, there aren’t enough 
resources to test everyone who meets the 
suspected case definition
• In these situations, the following people should be 
prioritized for testing:
➢ People at a higher risk of developing severe disease
➢ Health and care workers
➢ Inpatients in health facilities
➢ The first symptomatic individuals in a closed setting
• It is also important to expand and decentralize 
capacity to improve access to testing
• This can be done through expanding the 
laboratory network or by introducing more point 
of care tests such as Ag-RDTs

14
Use of Ag-RDTs
• NAAT-RT-PCR is the reference standard.  High 
quality Ag-RDTs helps to increase access to testing 
and support outbreak response, especially 
outside of lab and clinical settings
• Some Ag-RDTs have attained WHO Emergency 
Use Listing 
• Based on published data Ag-RDT results will be 
most reliable during the first 5-7 days after onset 
of symptoms and when SARS-CoV-2 prevalence is 
≥ 5%
• Shelf life (12 months) and storage conditions 
(max 30°C) will pose challenges for supply chains 
in many settings 
• End-users should be trained @ WHO/FIND have 
provided trainings
• Confirmatory testing by NAAT is not required, but 
should be considered based on the clinical history, 
presentation and epidemiological context
15
Protecting the health system
• Health and care workers account for around 7.7% 
of COVID-19 cases reported to WHO¹ 
• Health and care workers can be infected with 
SARS-CoV-2 while at their work or at the 
community level
• Those caring for COVID-19 patients are considered 
at a hither risk of being infected, therefore should 
be considered for testing, even if asymptomatic
• Testing is a key strategy 
➢ To treat and isolate cases when positive
➢ To reduce the risk of transmission to 
patients, co-workers, visitors and their 
contacts outside the health facility

SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies in settings with an increased risk of transmission*
• A higher-risk setting is any place where SARS-CoV-2 spreads more 
easily, such as poorly ventilated spaces or crowded indoor settings 
where people tend to spend longer periods of time 
• Higher risk settings include schools, workplaces, prisons, long-term living 
facilities and settings where people gather for long periods of time
• Recommended testing strategy:
➢ Persons showing any symptoms should isolate
➢ Test symptomatic persons, asymptomatic contacts of confirmed cases, and 
people caring for COVID-19 patients including health workers and long term 
care facility workers
➢ Treat and isolate persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 
➢ If there is limited testing capacity, testing symptomatic persons in settings 
with an increased risk of transmission should be prioritized
• Widespread testing of asymptomatic individuals is currently not 
recommended due to the significant costs associated with it and the lack 
of data on its effectiveness
• Use public health and social measures to limit transmission
* Outside health facilities https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-lab-testing-2021.1-eng
17
Transmission scenarios influence the predictive values of SARS-CoV-2 testing
• The different SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenarios 
affect the positive and negative predictive values of 
SARS-CoV-2 tests
➢ Positive predictive value is the probability that 
persons with a positive test truly have the 
disease
➢ Negative predictive value is the probability that 
persons with a negative test truly don't have 
the disease
• A SARS-CoV-2 test may have a poor positive 
predictive value (a high number of false positives) 
when used in a community where prevalence of 
SARS-CoV-2 is low 
• Therefore, in populations with few or no cases, it is 
preferable to use the reference NAAT to diagnose 
cases, as it better correctly identities persons 
without COVID-19

18
Transmission scenarios influence the predictive values of SARS-CoV-2 
testing - examples
For example, when applying this to Ag-RDTs with 80% sensitivity and 
97% specificity
in a fever clinic with a 27% prevalence of COVID-19:
91% of chance that a person testing POSITIVE for 
COVID-19 truly has COVID-19
at border screening with a 1% prevalence of COVID-19:
21% of chance that a person testing POSITIVE for 
COVID-19 truly has COVID-19
→ Therefore, in populations with few or no cases, it is preferable 
to use the reference NAAT to diagnose cases, as it better correctly 
identities persons without COVID-19

19
Testing for COVID-19 in the context of international travel
• Many countries test international travelers for SARS-CoV-2 prior to travel, at points of entry or 
after travel
• The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among travelers is expected to be low compared to the 
general population, considering that symptomatic travelers are prevented from travelling. This 
influences the predictive value of testing
• WHO does not recommend testing for healthy travelers, particularly where resources may be 
limited and/or diverted away from priority testing groups. Countries with sufficient resources 
that decide to implement testing of travelers, should do so based on risk assessment
• The risk assessment should consider the local epidemiological situation, health system capacities, 
volume of travel and arrangements for follow-up of incoming travelers who test positive
• Testing does not replace public health & social measures for epidemic control
• Negative results from pre-travel testing cannot guarantee that travelers are free from infection
at the time of travel
• Negative results may generate a false sense of security and disregard the precaution measures 
during travel and at arrival
• WHO does not recommend the issuance of so-called ‘immunity passports’
