29 November 2021
What is the EU Digital COVID Certificate?
Digital proof that a person has either
• been vaccinated against COVID-19
• received a negative test result
• recovered from COVID-19
What does it entail?
• Data is encoded, compressed and digitally signed in 
interoperable barcode
• Paper or digital format, easy to read
• Free of charge
• Bound to an EU citizen: 1 certificate, 1 holder
• Europe-wide validity 
• Signature validation key exchange is done via an EU Gateway
Regulation outline
• Legal basis: Art 21(2) TFEU – free movement of EU citizens within the EU
• Objective: to facilitate safe free movement during the pandemic by 
establishing a common framework – the EU Digital COVID Certificate – for 
the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable:
• vaccination certificates
• test certificates
• certificates of recovery
• May also be used by Member States for national purposes – if legal basis is 
provided for in national law: 20 Member States doing so
