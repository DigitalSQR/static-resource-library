Overview
TB patients and health-care providers are surrounded by information and communication technologies. They will be using these tools increasingly to
obtain better care. However, in doing so they are often faced with basic questions, such as: Which application is best suited to my circumstances?
What is the evidence for effectiveness? How do I implement it? Who will pay?
This handbook aims to address some of these questions. It focuses specifically on three technologies that are being widely used to help TB patients
complete their treatment over the many months that their regimens last.
In 2017, WHO published its first evidence-based recommendations for the use of digital technologies  in support of TB treatment delivery and
adherence. Based on available evidence and on feedback from users of short message service (SMS), medication event monitoring systems (MEMS)
and video-supported treatment (VOT), the handbook details the main elements that the manager or other end-user needs to think through at different
stages of implementation.
The handbook is aligned to the WHO/ERS digital health “agenda for action” for TB and stresses the need for continued learning, as opportunities
expand with technologies in constant flux.
