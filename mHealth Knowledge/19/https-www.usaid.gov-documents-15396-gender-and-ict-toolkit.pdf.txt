(14	MB)	Gender	and	ICT	Toolkit
Gender	and	Information	Communication	Technology	(ICT)	Toolkit
In	low	and	middle	income	countries,	over	1.7	billion	women	do	not	own	mobile	phones	–	or,	in	percentage	terms,	women	are	14	percent	less	likely
to	own	a	mobile	phone,	compared	to	men.	Furthermore,	even	if	a	woman	does	own	a	mobile	phone,	we	know	that	she	is	far	less	likely	to	make	full
use	of	its	suite	of	services.	Several	industry	stakeholders	have	made	efforts	to	understand	this	gender	gap,	but	the	data	remains	fragmented	and
lacks	standardization.	As	USAID	and	implementing	partners	increasingly	utilize	mobile	technology	in	their	humanitarian	and	development
interventions,	this	data	gap	is	becoming	critical	and	can	inhibit	effective	program	design.
The	Gender	and	ICT	Survey	Toolkit	provides	a	set	of	resources	for	obtaining	a	landscape	assessment	of	gender	and	ICT,	providing	implementing
partners	currently	operating	and	planning	on-the	ground	programming	with	practical,	well	researched	tools	they	can	use	to	obtain	data	on
women’s	access	and	usage	of	mobile	phones	and	other	connected	devices.	This	data	can	be	used	to	inform	project	design	or	create	a	baseline	to
understand	the	efficacy	of	an	ICT	intervention.	The	Toolkit	instructs	users	on	how	to	understand	the	implications	of	landscape	assessments	and
apply	learnings	to	their	projects	and	program	portfolios.	It	is	important	to	note	that,	while	this	is	an	ICT	toolkit,	and	references	several	different
forms	of	ICTs,	the	primary	focus	is	on	mobile.
