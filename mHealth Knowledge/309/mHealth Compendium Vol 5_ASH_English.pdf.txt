describes some of the major 
mHealth applications being 
utilized in Africa.
Finance
Mobile money applications are increasingly used in Africa 
to facilitate payment for health services and other expenses 
associated with seeking care for both private patients and 
clients enrolled in various community health programs. 
These mobile money applications allow registered users 
to load money into their accounts, make transfers to 
other users (both registered or not), and withdraw money. 
While registration for these services is almost always free, 
transactions have a predetermined fee which is often covered 
by the specific health program or implementing partner 
supporting the intervention. Examples of how mHealth 
applications have been utilized include provision of vouchers Service Delivery

of these applications allow a lower-level health facility to 
transmit information regarding their supply of essential 
medicines to the higher-level facility or warehouse which 
then provides the commodities. In some cases, these 
applications have even been utilized by CHWs to ensure 
they have the basic supplies needed.

Increasing access to mHealth and eHealth information in Africa
In most African nations, there is less than one physician per 1,000 people. Instead, community health 
workers (CHWs) are often the first line of defense against illness, and globally CHWs prevent a 
death once every three seconds.1,2 To build up the skills and capacities of primary health care systems, 
CHWs, and lay people, Hesperian Health Guides created the HealthWiki, an online source of clear, 
actionable, and thorough health information.3 With a lightweight, searchable format, the HealthWiki 
is accessible via computer or mobile device, and allows users to browse eight free volumes of health 
information on a range of topics, including family planning, early childhood development, first aid, 
noncommunicable diseases, environmental health, and disabilities. The HealthWiki has been online 
since October 2011 and has since been translated into 12 languages. By tracking the use patterns of 
users through Google Analytics, we may observe the health information-seeking behavior of end users 
to inform future content development and translation initiatives, and also compare the Pan-African 
health information-seeking behavior with global trends in HealthWiki use.

EBOLATXT
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  September 2014 to March 2015 (ongoing in Sierra Leone) 
Using SMS for social mobilization and reporting on the Ebola outbreak 
The recent Ebola outbreak resulted in thousands of deaths due to a lack of knowledge and 
misinformation about containing the virus. EbolaTxt was conceived from Text to Change (TTC)’s 
experience in other health-related campaigns. EbolaTxT provides contextualized, personal, accurate, 
and reliable information about Ebola in times of crisis through the use of short message service (SMS), 
an instantaneous, interactive, and cost-effective tool to reach people quickly. The aim of EbolaTxT is 
to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus. Due to the interactivity of EbolaTxT with other platforms in 
mobile phones, it can be used for improving awareness or education. Citizens can report suspected 
cases using their mobile phones, and can access resources to locate and ascertain available capacities 
of health clinics. The scalability of EbolaTxt enables it to be deployed across five countries within four 
months. TTC’s in-house SMS platform Vusion can reach a number of people, primarily also through 
TTC’s connection with different mobile providers in multiple countries.

IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  December 2013 to February 2015
Creating mobile phone support groups for HIV-infected adolescents 
in South Africa
There is growing awareness that HIV/AIDS-affected and -infected adolescents may be at increased risk 
of mental health problems and distress.1 Depression and anxiety are associated with noncompliance 
of medical treatment which, in turn, can further impact health. In South Africa, challenging home 
environments and stigma in the community weaken support structures at a crucial time when young 
people are navigating their developing sexuality and HIV status, as well as many other issues associated 
with adolescence.2 Despite the need for more support structures for HIV-infected adolescents, such as 
support groups, in countries like South Africa it can often be challenging to provide them.3 Challenges 
include stigma, discrimination, finding a space to run the support groups in often overcrowded hospitals 
and having adequately trained staff and the capacity to provide regular sessions. Furthermore, in many 
under-resourced contexts, individuals have to travel long distances to access health care facilities with 
limited access to transport. These opportunity costs may mean choosing not to attend support groups, 
which are often seen as “nice-to-have” rather than essential in facilitating compliance of treatment and 
providing support through the various related challenges of HIV/AIDS.

Text-based youth engagement tool with real-time data analysis 
During the Ebola outbreak of 2014, UNICEF identified a need to improve information communication 
flows between relevant government ministries and the affected communities. This need was identified in 
Nigeria, where U-Report already existed as a general SMS-based youth engagement platform, as well as 
in countries where it did not exist, such as Liberia and Sierra Leone.1
Once the need was identified, U-Report was used as an innovative solution that could be implemented 
relatively quickly and be community-led while supporting governments to combat the disease. In 
partnership with governments, the tool was used to understand knowledge gaps and provide necessary 
information to fill them, as had previously been done during Ebola outbreaks in Uganda in 2012.  The 
application of lessons learned combined with the improved transferable SMS RapidPro technology 
underlying U-Report enabled swift implementation.2,3

ALIVE & THRIVE
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  November 2011 to August 2012
Integrating breastfeeding education, cell phones, and microcredit 
to improve breastfeeding practices in Nigeria
Alive & Thrive (A&T) is an initiative to save lives, prevent illness, and ensure healthy growth and 
development through improved breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices. Good nutrition in 
the first 1,000 days, from conception to two years of age, is critical to enable all children to lead healthier 
and more productive lives.
A&T tested the effect of an intervention—combining breastfeeding education, cell phone messaging, and 
microcredit programs—on breastfeeding practices in urban and rural areas of Bauchi State in northern 
Nigeria. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill collaborated with Partners for Development to 
implement the project with funding from A&T’s small grants program. The goal of the small grants program, 
managed by the University of California, Davis, was to identify new solutions for scaling up effective and 
sustainable interventions to improve infant and young child feeding by linking research to program delivery.
The project promoted optimal breastfeeding behaviors—early initiation of breastfeeding (within the first 
hour after birth) and exclusive breastfeeding (giving babies only breast milk with no additional foods or 
fluids for the first six months). Exclusive breastfeeding improves child survival, growth, and development, 
yet only one-third of infants less than six months of age are exclusively breastfed in sub-Saharan Africa.1 
The rate is even lower in Nigeria, declining from 17 percent in 2003 to 13 percent in 2008.2,3

PROJECTING HEALTH
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  April 2012 to May 2015
Catalyzing behavior change through visual communication
India accounts for one-third of the world’s annual maternal deaths; in the country’s most populous 
state of Uttar Pradesh, the maternal mortality rate was 440 per 100,000 live births in 2011, and the 
neonatal mortality rate was 50 per 1,000 live births. India as a whole accounts for 28 percent of the 
world’s newborn deaths. In resource-poor settings, simple interventions such as birth spacing, birth 
preparedness, hygienic delivery, thermal care, and immediate breastfeeding could prevent the majority 
of these deaths. Effective, novel, and low-cost strategies for achieving improved health practices at the 
home and community levels are needed, especially in areas where staffing shortages and low literacy 
levels are common.1

IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  August 2014 
Promoting maternal and child health well-being through 
mobile health messaging
Although there are numerous projects in South Africa seeking to use mobile technology to reach 
pregnant women and mothers, MomConnect is the first large-scale mHealth implementation run by 
the National Department of Health. This is significant in the context of South African mHealth but 
also enormously important for the mHealth community as a whole as it is one of the few instances 
globally where an mHealth initiative has been adopted by a national health department and is being 
implemented nationwide. MomConnect seeks to mitigate the negative outcomes around pregnancy 
and childbirth. In South Africa, 40 out of every 1,000 children die before the age of five and for every 
100,000 births, approximately 140 women die during pregnancy and childbirth. These statistics are 
substantially higher than the Millennium Development Goal targets for South Africa.

Implementing a smartphone-based biometric system 
for participant identification and tracking
Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region most heavily affected by HIV with nearly 70 percent of the 
34 million people living with the disease globally residing in the region nearly three decades into the 
epidemic.1,2 Youth aged 15 to 24 bear the highest burden of new infections and account for 80 percent 
of the 1.9 million new infections in sub-Saharan Africa each year.3 HIV is a major crisis in Nyanza, 
Kenya, with HIV prevalence of 15.1 percent among those aged 15 to 49 compared to national 
prevalence of 5.6 percent.4 Few Ministry of Health facilities are tailored specifically to the needs of 
youth in this region. MP3-Youth is a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a gender-
specific combination HIV-prevention package in high-burden settings. MP3-Youth aims to pilot the 
combination package in a mobile health delivery format using an integrated HIV combination/HIV 
prevention services approach in Kenya. Feasibility and acceptability will be determined by examining 
uptake and coverage of the intervention package among youth.

Increasing data collection efficiency through mobile phones in Angola
Many global health monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems rely on paper-based data collection and 
data verification in the field. Supervisory staff members inadvertently overlook data errors during 
quality control, and data clerks commit data entry errors when transferring data from paper forms to 
electronic databases. Program staff members spend significant time transporting data from remote 
villages to data centers and entering data. These challenges affect the data quality and accessibility and 
impede corrective action to improve program operations. To overcome these supervisory issues and

IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  October 2014 to December 2014
Increase bednet distribution accountability 
and usage in households through mobile data collection 
Malaria is one of the deadliest diseases in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where an 
estimated 500 children under the age of five die each day from this disease. Research has shown that 
the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) is effective in preventing malaria.1  
To address malaria prevention through LLIN distribution, IMA World Health, with approval from the 
Programme National de Lutte contre de Paludisme (PNLP) of the Ministry of Public Health and funding 
from the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) and UK Aid, kicked off a mass LLIN distribution campaign 
in eight health zones in Kasai-Occidental province. IMA World Health devised a Hang-up and Track 
(HUT) campaign in which community health workers (CHWs) not only distributed the LLINs, but they 
also installed and hung them up in each household and recorded household registration data using 
smart phones to ensure accountability and accuracy.

Across four community health projects, Catholic Relief Services (CRS) Senegal directly works with 
2,139 unofficial community health workers (CHWs), and through this work identified a challenge 
in ensuring quality and timely data collection, reporting, and effective health messaging/sensitization. 
Specifically, CHWs are delayed in transmitting important information at the health hut level to the 
health post or CRS staff, lack proper documentation of available and expired medicine, and delay 
communication on important health information until the end of the month when information from 
daily consultation is compiled.  
Furthermore, data analysis from the health huts is analyzed quarterly, often when trends such as 
high malaria rates have already occurred and timely messaging or response is subsequently late and 
ineffective. The current paper reporting system does not allow for timely community sensitization and 
responses regarding increases in illness.

was constrained due to 
a number of causes. The 
SEDA mobile phone-based 
reporting system for health 
data assists in easier and 
more timely reporting. 
SEDA Automated Health Data Exchange System
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  October 2011 to Present 
Applying mHealth to improve data monitoring in Senegal 
In Senegal, the Automated Health Data Exchange System (SEDA) is an integrated health data and 
stock-out monitoring system that uses inexpensive and ubiquitous mobile phones for data collection, 
reporting, and supervision. Data are aggregated in a web-based central system to visualize and manage 
decision support. SEDA targets the IntraHealth International-led Health Services Improvement (HSI) 
project’s aim to improve the quality and frequency of data collected at the district and regional levels in 
partnership with Senegal’s Ministry of Health and Social Action. A prime goal of SEDA is to transform 
the methods and speed with which health workers, supervisors, and senior-level ministry staff use 
collected data to make decisions about maternal, neonatal, and child health programs, and to prevent 
stock-outs of essential medicines and contraceptive products. Prior to SEDA, available data were often 
outdated, incomplete, and unreliable. This situation left the ministry unable to make timely decisions 
to improve health programs, appropriately deploy health workers, or positively influence the health of 
clients and their families.

needs of health providers, 
decision-makers, and the 
populations they serve. 
OPENSRP: Open Smart Register Platform
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  2013 to Present 
Connecting frontline health workers to national health systems 
Frontline health workers (FHWs) form the backbone of the health system in low- and middle-income 
countries (LMICs). They are the first contact for primary health care for millions of underserved people, 
yet are often burdened by archaic paper systems. Paper registers present strategic challenges for 
tabulation and access to real-time data for decision-making, monitoring FHW performance at district or 
national level, and providing a reasonable level of accountability for authentic and complete individual 
data records. Paper-based data also do not facilitate continuity of care between visits or across providers. 
Consequently, clients who have missed services or appointments are not identified in a timely fashion, 
leading to a missed window of opportunity for intervention. Lastly, governments struggle to supervise 
this large workforce, ensure data quality and timeliness of reporting, and facilitate appropriate and 
equitable care under low-resource conditions.

IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  January 2013 to June 2014 
Using mobile phones to support Helping Babies Breathe in Kenya 
Intrapartum asphyxia, the inability to breathe at birth, is a leading cause of newborn death, killing an 
estimated 814,000 infants every year. Resource-limited settings bear a disproportionate burden of 
asphyxia-related mortality, with global epicenters located in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Helping 
Babies Breathe (HBB) is a simple, inexpensive, evidence-based, and skills-focused program designed to 
facilitate improvements in knowledge, skills, and performance for neonatal resuscitation (NR) among 
birth attendants in resource-limited areas. HBB has been launched in more than 70 countries since June 
2010, and has been shown to improve the NR knowledge, skills, and performance of birth attendants, 
and reduce newborn mortality. 1–6 However, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) efforts have struggled to 
keep pace with the rapid global roll-out of HBB. Data collection and reporting of key M&E indicators 
are constrained by a cumbersome paper-based data collection system. The resulting gaps, time-lags, and 
bottlenecks in information make it difficult for stakeholders to know when, where, and how HBB is 
being implemented, ascertain its effectiveness, and efficiently allocate resources.

IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  April 2012 to May 2015 
Improving regulatory capacity to enhance pharmaceutical 
product and service quality 
Many people in rural Tanzania seek health care and medicines from retail drug shops, which historically 
had unqualified, untrained and unsupervised sellers.1 1 Launched in 2003, the Accredited Drug 
Dispensing Outlet (ADDO) program sought to improve access to affordable, quality medicines 
and pharmaceutical services in underserved areas through a combination of training, incentives, and 
regulatory oversight of set standards.2 One of the goals of Management Sciences for Health (MSH)’s 
Sustainable Drug Seller Initiatives (SDSI) program was to assure the ADDO program’s long-term 
sustainability by increasing access to data for informed program decision-making. With nationwide scale-
up and over 9,000 shops accredited or nearly accredited in Tanzania, the Pharmacy Council of  Tanzania 
(PC) needed a comprehensive database to organize information on ADDO and pharmacy facilities 
and personnel. In addition, PC was interested in using mobile technology to improve its communication, 
reporting, and fees collection systems for these facilities. SDSI collaborated with Invention and 
Technological Ideas Development Organization (ITIDO), a local group, to help PC meet its needs.

IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  October 2011 to December 2014
An integrated intervention to improve the quality of care during delivery in Zanzibar
In Tanzania, despite high rates of antenatal care and relatively good access to health facilities, maternal 
and neonatal mortality remain high at 310/100,000 live births and 28/1,000 live births, respectively, and 
almost half of all deliveries are performed at home without a skilled attendant.1,2 Through commitment 
to Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 and 5, as well as the government strategy for growth and 
reduction of poverty, the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar has made a strong commitment to 
prioritizing this issue.3 However, significant reduction in mortality will not be achieved without increasing 
skilled care at birth. Hence, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has set specific targets to increase facility 
delivery from approximately half of deliveries up to 80 percent. D-tree International has been partnering 
with the MOH at the central and district levels since 2011 to help achieve this target. 
In Zanzibar, through the mHealth for Safer Deliveries project, D-tree and the MOH seek to reduce all of 
the “three delays” to receiving quality care at birth: (1) the decision to seek care; (2) reaching skilled care; 
and (3) the provision of adequate care at the health facility.4 The project ensures that mothers and their 
newborns reach care when they need it by engaging community health workers (CHWs) at the lowest 
levels and arming them with the knowledge, tools, and motivation to serve families at home.

IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  2010 to Present
Financial risk protection for people with non-communicable diseases in Pakistan
There are two health systems models operating in the world: the Beveridge system, in which revenues 
fund public facilities and services, and the Bismark system, where pooled funds and intermediary agencies 
procure services from the private sector for those employed in the formal sector. These models are 
limited in their ability to offer financial risk protection to the poor working in the informal sector, especially 
in countries with mixed health systems where public and private service providers coexist but out-of-
pocket payments remain the major means of health financing. 
In such settings, public sector facilities do not offer free onsite services for the entire spectrum of needs. 
Therefore, individuals seeking care for major illnesses, especially non-communicable diseases, end up 
spending catastrophically on healthcare and are either pushed into poverty or forgo healthcare altogether. 
These problems exist in Pakistan as well as in most developing countries with mixed health systems. 
Access to financial services has been termed as one of the three impediments to seeking healthcare in 
WHO’s World Health Report on Health Financing, 2010. Heartfile has developed a health system model 
to overcome this gap.

Technology for Saving One Million Lives” (ICT4SOML) initiative in 2012; this initiative intends to increase 
government response to maternal mortality and bring Nigeria closer to reaching the Millennium 
Development Goals related to maternal and child health.
Mobile interventions and applications have been shown to improve health outcomes related to 
maternal health by providing decision support to patients and community health workers, improving case 
management of pregnant women and new mothers, and providing efficient, secure means for conducting 
financial transactions related to health care. Mobile money also has the potential to reach many patients 
who do not currently have access to banking services. The Nigerian government’s Subsidy Reinvestment 
and Empowerment Program (SURE-P) is currently implementing a conditional cash transfer (CCT) 
scheme through which mothers are incentivized to attend a continuum of maternal and neonatal health 
services. SURE-P is using a cash-based disbursement system that is both expensive and inefficient and has 
partnered with Pathfinder International to integrate mobile solutions into the SURE-P CCT program.

Airtel Insurance with MicroEnsure
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  January 2014 to Present
Sustainable health microinsurance at scale
Health insurance penetration in Africa remains under 1 percent, serving fewer than 3 million people, 
despite there being over 400 non-profit and private health insurance schemes active across the 
continent. Along with a range of other factors, the high expense of traditional health insurance keeps 
it out of the hands of the mass market. While public health insurance projects are underway in many 
markets, MicroEnsure decided to pursue a complimentary private solution with Airtel, a pan-African 
telecommunications company.
By introducing consumers to a free, basic health insurance product, establishing trust through transparent, 
reliable operations, and then offering iterative up-sell products to allow customers to increase their 
coverage by paying larger premiums, MicroEnsure believed it could create an alternative path to health 
insurance coverage.

INFORMED PUSH MODEL
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  August 2013 to Present
Scaling logistics management information systems via push models 
for increased family planning access and use 
In Senegal, the absence of a well-functioning family planning product supply chain has been a barrier 
that has contributed to Senegal’s low contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) (12.3 percent in 2010) and 
high unmet need for family planning among married women (29 percent). Recurrent family planning 
product stock-outs at nearly 80 percent of public service delivery points (SDPs) continue to hinder the 
government’s ability to achieve its goal of more than doubling CPR to 27 percent by 2015. To improve 
the supply chain and ensure the steady availability of contraceptive products, IntraHealth International 
is expanding the approach known as the Informed Push Model (IPM) nationally in Senegal. Successful 
IPM implementation depends on the availability of routine SDP-level product consumption data, but the 
data have historically been unreliable or unavailable in Senegal. IntraHealth is collaborating with Dimagi 
to solve this problem by implementing a customized version of CommTrack as the IPM’s logistics 
management information system (LMIS).

Improving the quality of child health care at the primary level 
through integrated decision-support tools
Malawi is among nine low-income countries that successfully reduced its under-five mortality rate by 60 
percent or more between 1990 and 2011.1, 2 Despite this progress, large numbers of children continue to 
die unnecessarily from conditions that are easily preventable and treatable.  A large proportion of children 
in Malawi are still at increased risk of mortality due to common childhood infections. The leading causes 
of under-five mortality in Malawi are malaria (13 percent),  AIDS (13 percent), pneumonia (11 percent), 
diarrhea (7 percent), and neonatal conditions (31 percent). The Ministry of Health (MOH) has been 
collaborating with partners to scale up a package of high-impact interventions to reduce under-five child 
mortality since 2007 under the Accelerated Child Survival and Development (ACSD) strategy. These 
efforts have included integrated community case management (iCCM) in hard-to-reach (HTR) areas to 
complement fixed or scheduled facility-based services. To improve the quality of care provided to under-
five children, D-tree International is providing mHealth to support the implementation of iCCM.

The Local Partners Excel in Comprehensive HIV & AIDS Service Delivery (LEAD) project, funded by 
the Centers for Disease Control under PEPFAR, supports prevention of mother-to-child transmission 
(PMTCT) services at 509 facilities in the Mara and Tanga regions of Tanzania. Most are health centers 
and dispensaries in remote locations with unreliable or no sources of funds to transport reports and 
travel to collect medical supplies. These factors contribute to regular stock outs of health commodities 
needed for HIV testing of pregnant women and exposed infants. In July 2010, LEAD introduced the use

Mobile alerts to increase reporting rates and reduce potential 
stock outs of family planning commodities 
The Government of Bangladesh has made noteworthy progress over the past decade in increasing access 
to family planning (FP) methods. From 2001 to 2011, the total fertility rate decreased by 23 percent (from 
3.0 to 2.3 births per woman), the maternal mortality ratio decreased by 40 percent (from 322 to 194 
maternal deaths per 100,000 live births), and the percentage of married women with an unmet need for 
FP decreased from 17 percent to 14 percent. 
As part of the FP 2020 global partnership, Bangladesh has further committed to reduce the total fertility 
rate to 2.0 by 2016 and 1.7 by 2021 by increasing adolescent-friendly sexual reproductive health and FP 
services to one-third of maternal, newborn, and child health centers. However, ensuring uninterrupted 
availability of FP commodities is crucial to meet these targets. Though recording and reporting on stock 
levels is a critical component of the supply chain management cycle, the linkages between facility-level 
information and national-level program policies and plans have traditionally been weak. Thus, accurate 
forecasting of essential FP commodities remains a challenge.

DRUGSTOC
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  2015
A hybrid eHub of drugs and medical consumables in Nigeria 
The Nigerian healthcare market is characterized by an abundance of substandard, counterfeit drugs. In 
2001, it was estimated that about 50 percent of all drugs within the market were fake. This rate is said 
to have fallen over the next five years by about 80 percent following aggressive action by the Nigerian 
National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC).
This problem is further exacerbated by a fragmented drug system, where health providers often 
purchase from multiple wholesalers, directly from manufacturers, and from open air drug markets 
simultaneously. This system leads to inefficiencies in the drug market, where prices are incomparable 
and opaque, and where health providers are unable to certify the quality of the drugs bought in the 
open drug markets or from unscrupulous distributors of drugs. No collated database exists that allows 
hospitals to view all available brand variations and make purchasing decisions based on the right pricing 
for their market. As a result of this fragmented system, prices often change sporadically and variety 
is limited to the health provider’s exposure to products they are familiar with. To put this in context, 
average drug prices in Nigeria range from two to 64 times the international prices in both private and 
public health facilities, according to a recent UNIDO report on the Nigerian pharmaceutical sector.

Supply Chains for Community Case Management 
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  2011 to Present
Using mobile technology to increase community access to 
life-saving medicines in Malawi 
In Malawi in 2010, the mortality rate among children under 5 years old was above the global average at 
112 deaths per 1000 live births.1 Despite the introduction of community case management in 2008 to 
improve children’s health in remote areas, poor infrastructure and lack of access to stock information 
resulted in regular stock outs of critical medicines.  A 2010 assessment2 showed that only 23 percent 
of health surveillance assistants (HSAs) had in stock the four key life-saving medicines needed to treat 
all three targeted childhood illnesses (malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea). At the same time, central land 
district-level managers had little access to community logistics data, limiting their ability to respond to 
local needs.

Mobile delivery of health extension worker training materials
Health workers in Ethiopia are generally under-trained. The standard training pedagogy can often 
involve an excessive use of text-heavy, didactic lecturing that lacks the interactive, participatory 
pedagogy needed for effective adult learning. Moreover, there is little follow up on how health workers 
use their newly acquired knowledge and skills.1 Research on the introduction of ICT in education 
has shown that it is effective only when developers understand the strengths and weaknesses of the 
technology and integrate the technology into appropriate pedagogical practices.2,3,4 To supplement and 
enhance learning within existing training programs, the UK-based company Digital Campus’ technical 
and medical team have developed OppiaMobile, an open source mobile learning platform for delivering 
learning content, video, and quizzes, specifically designed for-low resource environments with poor

Enhancing Neonatal Survival in Rural South Asia
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  October 2011 to January 2015
Connecting people, compressing time, and creating opportunities
Over the past decade, despite marked progress in reducing under-five mortality, neonatal mortality 
continues to contribute to more than 55 percent of under-five child deaths in Bangladesh.1 In the 
rural northwest of the country, around 26 percent of pregnant women receive the World Health 
Organization (WHO)-recommended four complete antenatal care (ANC) visits, and 27 percent of 
all women receive a postnatal care (PNC) check-up by a trained medical practitioner within two days 
of childbirth, a practice considered essential to the health of the mother and the vulnerable neonate.2 
More than 20 percent of infants are born preterm, and nearly half are low birth weight—unprepared 
to encounter the many challenges home-based deliveries present.3 
Our community-based research studies, over a span of nearly two decades, of maternal and neonatal 
mortality within the rural populations of northwest Bangladesh identified information gaps between 
the rural community and community health workers (CHWs) beginning with low rates of early 
identified incident pregnancies, no formal mechanisms to remind pregnant women of when an ANC 
visit is due, the importance of these visits, and a lack of birth reporting timeliness.4 These all contribute 
to reaching the mother or newborn in time, compounding referral inefficiencies that interrupt the 
provision of life-saving strategies which increase the risk of preventable neonatal death. The mCARE 
study involved extensive formative research, stakeholder engagement activities, and preliminary testing 
of the mCARE technical system to digitally optimize the workflow of CHWs and create opportunities 
for them to better connect and engage with their clients (pregnant women and their newborns) via 
the mCARE system.

IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  September 2013 to December 2014 
A virtual vaccine record, reminder, and session management 
system designed for frontline immunizers
Bangladesh has a population of more than 162 million with more than 1 million births every year.  
The mTikka system was designed to assist Government of Bangladesh frontline immunizers in providing 
timely immunizations to newborns and children under five by addressing barriers identified during 
formative research. Barriers identified include the inability to track a child’s vaccination history, the lack 
of timely vaccination reminders, the lack of incentives for families to take children to be vaccinated, and 
limited awareness about vaccine effectiveness. 
mTikka provides solutions to each of these barriers. To ensure availability of vaccination history, mTikka 
maintains a copy of the child’s immunization record on the server that is also accessible by the caregiver’s 
phone number or scanning of a unique identifier code bracelet given to each child at registration. To 
provide timely reminders, mTikka sends server-generated short message service (SMS) reminders to 
the mobile number linked to children’s records the day before they are due to attend an immunization 
session. Additionally, the health assistant (HA) pushed alerts the morning of a vaccination session when 
the HA is actually present and ready to provide immunizations. 
To address lack of incentives, mobile flexi-loads were given to vaccine advocates (VA)—individuals 
nominated by the family to receive and relay these SMS alerts on their behalf—to incentivize sharing 
immunization reminders and alert messages with the families who nominated them. Lastly, to address 
limited awareness about vaccine effectiveness, in each child’s registration form in mTikka is a vaccine 
beliefs survey, comprised of 10 true-false questions and answers that serve as a guide for HAs with 
which to counsel mothers and caregivers on basic vaccine facts.

HELP: Health Enablement and Learning Platform
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  June 2013 to May 2014 
Training and empowering community health workers on basic mobile phones 
Africa has a drastic shortage of community health workers (CHWs). Although many ministries 
of health have made a community health strategy an integral part of their approach to universal 
health coverage, the training and empowerment of CHWs remains a challenge. Many ministries face 
common challenges, such as expensive classroom training with unpredictable attendance, lack of 
reliable reporting from CHWs in the field, declining CHW engagement, and a high dropout rate in the 
absence of paid incentives.  
The HELP mobile learning (mLearning) solution is a learning platform, aligned to the Kenya Ministry 
of Health CHW curriculum, for health worker training and empowerment. It provides initial training, 
complementary to face-to-face training, and continuous professional development to CHWs to help 
reinforce critical teachings. HELP employs a structured learning mPedagogy which applies advanced 
learning principles and approaches to basic mobile channels in a combination of “patterns” that 
simulate the learning experience and outcomes of traditional face-to-face training methods.

Emergency triage assessment and treatment for primary care
Forty-one thousand children died before reaching their fifth birthday in Malawi in 2013. Over half of 
these deaths were caused by illnesses (i.e. meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia, and diarrhea) that are both 
preventable and treatable with earlier recognition and intervention.1 In the absence of systematic 
triage at the primary health care level in Malawi, a common challenge is the lack of early and accurate 
recognition of serious illness requiring urgent referral to a higher-level facility. Patients are seen on a first-
come, first-served basis and severe illnesses are often missed as hundreds of children queue for hours.

for Community-Based Family Planning Services
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  November 2014 to September 2016 
Using a mobile application to guide community health workers to provide 
high-quality family planning services in Tanzania
Tanzania is faced with significant sexual and reproductive health challenges, including high fertility rates, 
low contraceptive prevalence, and elevated rates of HIV/AIDS. In 2010, the contraceptive prevalence 
rate (CPR) for modern methods among married women was 27 percent, and the unmet need for 
family planning was 25 percent.1 In Shinyanga region in northwest Tanzania, 12.5 percent of married 
women age 15 to 49 use a modern family planning method, less than half of the national average. The 
total fertility rate (TFR) is 7.1 compared with the national TFR of 5.4, and HIV prevalence is 7.4 percent 
compared to the national average of 5.1 percent. 
In order to improve access to family planning services, Pathfinder International and D-tree International 
are implementing a community-based family planning program using mobile technology to improve the 
quality of care. This program is being implemented with 230 community health workers (CHWs) and 
32 CHW supervisors in five districts of Shinyanga region.

ePARTOGRAM
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  January to June 2015 
Improving the management of labor and deliveries to reduce 
maternal and perinatal mortality in Tanzania
Maternal mortality is a major public health challenge in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan 
Africa. Most maternal and newborn mortality occurs around the time of delivery, and hence can be 
prevented with simple measures, including appropriate training, supplies, and equipment. One important 
tool for a safe delivery is the paper-based partogram, a graphical depiction of labor that supports 
decision-making during the management of labor to prevent and detect complications. Endorsed by the 
World Health Organization (WHO) for over 30 years, appropriate use of the partogram can decrease 
maternal and perinatal mortality by reducing prolonged or obstructed labor, sepsis, and unnecessary 
operative interventions.1,2
Despite these clear benefits, use of the paper partogram in developing countries is low and 
inconsistent.3,4 Challenges to consistent use are related to learning and remembering how to fill 
it in appropriately, and—once filled in—knowing how to interpret the clinical implications of the 
observations. Birth attendants may find it cumbersome, time-consuming, and simply fail to see its clinical 
value. To address the key challenges in partogram use and appropriate management of labor and 
delivery, Jhpiego, in collaboration with D-tree International, has developed an electronic, tablet-based 
tool which aims to be easier to use and provides the feedback missing from the paper version, through 
reminders and alarms.  The tool stores data both locally and on a server, which allows supervisors, 
referral facilities, and experts real-time access to patient care information.

Connecting and empowering health workers through mobile phones in Liberia
Severe shortages of qualified health workers and poor communication and coordination among those on 
the front lines have exacerbated the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa. These challenges 
were hindering the delivery of quality health services in the region even before the outbreak.1 Harnessing 
mobile technology and using it to improve existing health information systems (HIS) makes it possible to 
rapidly strengthen communication among health authorities, the health workforce, and local communities, 
in order to save lives.  
In August 2014, the mHero Partnership, led by IntraHealth International, the US Agency for International 
Development (USAID), UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and a team of international stakeholders, 
created mHero.2 The mHero platform allows health workers, government authorities, and other key 
stakeholders to engage in real-time, targeted communication via two-way short message service (SMS), 
interactive voice response, and direct calls. mHero communications, which are flexible and scalable, and 
can be triggered both centrally and locally, go far beyond the traditional “message blasts” offered by many 
technology vendors, enabling stakeholders to rapidly respond to health workers’ needs.

MOBILE APP  
for Management of HIV in Pregnancy
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  March 2015 - Present 
Reducing perinatal transmission of HIV by improving information management
Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) taken by a woman during the peripartum period 
can virtually eliminate perinatal transmission of HIV.1 Access and adherence to medication; a skilled, 
knowledgeable workforce; and patient retention, tracking, and monitoring are essential. However, 
much of the world suffers severe health care staffing and information deficits. Mobile, electronic health 
technologies can compensate for these deficits by providing access to patient records, access to up-to-
date management guidelines, facilitating clinician and patient communication, retaining patients in care, 
and enabling extensive data mining and analysis.2 A mobile technology-enhanced, combined electronic 
medical record and clinical decision support-system aimed at the co-management of HIV and 
pregnancy has been developed and will be studied for usability and effects on management processes.

Using cellular phones to increase return rates for immunization services in Kenya
Immunization is a proven strategy for the prevention of childhood disease and mortality, yet 
undervaccination remains a challenge in parts of sub-Saharan Africa.  In Kenya, failure to complete the 
immunization schedule is an obstacle to ensuring full childhood immunization. Traditional home visits to 
track defaulting children have not successfully reduced drop-out rates due primarily to their costliness 
and the time-consuming task of tracking defaulters.  The assumption is that caregivers do not remember 
the appointment date led to development and use of short message service (SMS) reminders. These 
reminders, however, do not clarify the reasons behind failure to honor appointments. Widespread 
mobile phone penetration (over 65 percent) in Kenya presents an opportunity to use phones to trace 
defaulters and minimize dropout, as well as understand the reasons contributing to dropout. The US 
Agency for International Development Global Health Bureau’s flagship program, Maternal and Child 
Health Integrated Program (MCHIP), determined to test the use of phone contacts as an alternative 
approach for tracking immunization defaulters in four districts in western Kenya. For nine months, 
children accessing immunization services (pentavalent 1) in 12 facilities were followed.

Using mobile phones to address postpartum needs of mothers and newborns 
The health and development indicators of mothers and children in Uttar Pradesh, India, continue to 
be among the worst in the world with significantly higher rates among rural populations. The women 
in the rural Moradabad District face overwhelming barriers to essential maternal and newborn health 
care, including limited mobility due to social restrictions, limited availability of trained health providers 
in primary health centers (PHCs), poorly equipped and supplied PHCs, and lack of timely referral and 
skilled care at the community level. Because approximately 45 percent of postpartum maternal deaths 
and 25 to 45 percent of newborn deaths occur within 24 hours of birth, the World Health Organization 
recommends that all mothers and newborns receive a postpartum visit within this critical time frame. 
Initiated in 2011 as part of a broader government-run health scheme targeting rural populations 
throughout India, accredited social health activists are being training home-based newborn care 
(HBNC) with the expectation that they will conduct six postpartum home visits but not within the 
first 24 hours for facility-based deliveries. Most ASHAs in Moradabad have yet to receive this training, 
and ASHA performance is compromised by lack of skills and motivation, minimal incentives, and few 
opportunities for career progression. ASHA-LINKS to Postpartum Maternal and Newborn Health was 
designed by Project Concern International (PCI) in response to the critical need to address maternal 
and newborn morbidity and mortality in the rural areas of Moradabad in northern India, and because 
well-trained ASHAs play an invaluable role in assuring that rural mothers and their families are educated 
on healthy postpartum practices and supported through the identification of danger signs and the swift 
referral of life-threatening complications.

COMMCARE Mobile Job Aid for Sahiyas 
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  August 2014 to Present
Strengthening maternal and newborn health in India
Despite renewed efforts to improve maternal health outcomes, maternal mortality rates remain high 
in India. India recorded around 57,000 maternal deaths in 2010, and the country’s maternal mortality 
rate is nearly double its Millennium Development Goal of 109 deaths per 100,000 live births. The global 
health community has identified proven interventions for every stage of maternal care. Properly trained, 
motivated, and supervised community health workers (CHWs) have been shown to reduce neonatal 
mortality by up to 50 percent, making them a critical component in optimizing primary health care 
service delivery to the most remote and under-resourced locales.
mHealth interventions have demonstrated the effectiveness and relevance of mobile job aids in 
advancing the technical capacity and reporting of CHWs, as well as the quality of their behavior 
change communication services. These tools have been shown to increase worker motivation, and 
they provide a powerful set of tools for monitoring, supervising, and supporting community health 
programs. In this context, Dimagi developed mobile job aids for government CHWs in India, called 
Sahiyas, in partnership with the National Health Mission of Jharkhand; the US Agency for International 
Development Global Health Bureau’s flagship program, Maternal and Child Health Integrated Program 
(MCHIP); and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), through its flagship mHealth platform, CommCare. 
CommCare supports Sahiyas in the tracking of pregnant mothers and newborn children through the 
continuum of care, focusing on integrating comprehensive decision-support, extensive multimedia for 
low-literate users, and offline capabilities to work in low-resource settings.

Strengthening maternal and newborn health in Tanzania
Access to and uptake of comprehensive, quality maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) services 
are a prerequisite to reaching Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5. Unfortunately health indicators 
in Tanzania show that MNCH service utilization remains low. While 96 percent of pregnant women 
attend at least one antenatal care (ANC) visit and immunization coverage among children is high, there 
is a lack of continuity with the uptake of institutional deliveries at 50 percent and postnatal care (PNC) 
services within two days after birth as low as 31 percent.1, 2 Because these services are not provided 
with a continuum of care approach, there are missed opportunities to provide essential MNCH 
interventions to mothers and their infants. 
One gap in current service provision at reproductive and child health (RCH) clinics is the lack of patient 
records, which would allow health workers to monitor and follow up mothers and their infants along a 
continuum, beginning with the initial ANC visit. The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) 
and its partner, D-tree International, have developed a decision-support application and electronic 
patient record system, which can track uptake of MNCH services along the continuum of care. This 
application is being implemented in 25 health facilities in six districts of the Tabora region.

CYCLETEL Family Advice & CYCLETEL Humsafar 
IMPLEMENTATION DATE:  CycleTel Family Advice–March 2015 to Present; CycleTel Humsafar–2011 to Present 
Bridging the gap between family planning knowledge and behavior
Does fertility awareness and family planning information impact attitudes and behaviors around family 
planning? Could knowledge increase the likelihood of family planning method uptake? Georgetown 
University’s Institute for Reproductive Health (IRH) has developed a two-part service to answer this 
question. The first service, CycleTel Family Advice, is a series of 65 educational short message service 
(SMS) texts on fertility, family planning, couples communication, and related topics. Messages are written 
as conversational stories and targeted by age, sex, and marital status. CycleTel Family Advice users can 
also access the second service, CycleTel Humsafar, a family planning method directly on their phone. 
Based on the Standard Days Method® (SDM), CycleTel Humsafar helps a woman identify which 
days during her menstrual cycle she is most likely to become pregnant and alerts her on fertile days. 
IRH, in partnership with others, has followed a step-wise, systematic approach to CycleTel Humsafar 
development and pilot testing since 2010. Under the US Agency for International Development-funded 
FACT Project (2013-18), IRH and partners were able to design and develop the CycleTel Family Advice 
Service, and offer it at scale in India through a private sector partnership. Both services were made 
available to users starting in early 2015 and will be evaluated for behavioral outcomes. 
About CycleTel Family Advice and CycleTel Humsafar
IRH has partnered with Life Tools in India, a pre-installed over 18 months and provide users with 15 weeks of content application available on over 25 million phones in India. (users receive messages four times a week.) These messages 
Integrating with the Life Tools application, CycleTel Family will contain stories that illustrate common situations in family 
Advice Service and the CycleTel Humsafar services are now planning and provide information on fertility and family 
available in 12 local Indian languages and able to reach users planning topics. These stories have been pretested to ensure 
at scale. CycleTel Family Advice will reach 350,000 users that they are culturally appropriate and engaging.
