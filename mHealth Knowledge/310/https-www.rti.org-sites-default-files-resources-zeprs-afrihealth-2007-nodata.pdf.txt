Context: 2002
• Maternal mortality rate 940/1000
• Lifetime risk of death in pregnancy 1/25
• Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) at 
birth 30.7
• Virtually all modern health care for 2 
million women in Lusaka provided by 23 
clinics and the University Teaching 
Hospital (UTH)
• 13 of 23 clinics provide antenatal care, 9 
with labor wards
• 47,000 estimated total obstetric cases 
(2002)
• All medical records on paper
• Patients may move among clinics, but 
limited sharing of patient records Children outside Chainda Clinic, 
• No central database for monitoring patient Lusaka
population or quality of care

Key Problems & Proposed Solution
Key Problems
 Almost impossible to systematically assess 
care delivery
 Surveillance data limited to simple cross-
sectional statistics, such as how many 
stillbirths or pregnancy-attributable maternal 
deaths occur in a given month
 Even available statistics were suspect
 Occasional failure to test and frequent failure 
to follow up patients diagnosed with STDs
 Limited sharing of patient records between 
facilities
 No central database for monitoring patient 
population or quality of care
Proposed solution
Patient file storage at University 
 Electronic-first perinatal record system
Patient records shared among facilities Teaching Hospital, Lusaka
 Centralized patient records database
In 2005 only one-quarter of office-based physicians in the U.S. used a fully or partially electronic medical record system. (Burt, Catharine W., 
Hing, Esther, and Woodwell, David. U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, 2005.)

Challenges
Telecommunications
 Weak landline infrastructure
 Congested 2.4GHz wireless 
segment
Clinics
 Dusty, congested
 7 of 23 clinics had telephone lines 
 All clinics with VHF radio for voice
Personnel
 Low computer literacy
 Very stressed due to patient load
 High medical staff turn-over
Electrical Clinician at the door of the 
 Inadequate electrical systems at all Prisons Kamwala Clinic in 2002.
points, no backup power, No 
lightening protection
 Poorly regulated grid (Frequent 
power outages)

Wireless Network
 27km diameter 
hub-and-spoke 
line-of-sight 
wireless network
 3 – 9 PCs in 
each clinic
 Voice (VoIP) 
and data 
communication 
for all facilities

ZEPRS Key Concepts
• Guides medical personnel through Zambian 
standard of perinatal care 
• Concept of “flows” within the system and related 
data (user driven)
• Shared terminal usage
• Usage of ZEPRS data for quality assurance and 
supervision (export to SPSS, SAS..)
• Patient confidentiality
• Adaptability/Extensibility of ZEPRS system –
open source (HIV/ART, Safe Motherhood)
• Using mini applications to build computing skills

ZEPRS Key medical features
• Safe Motherhood
• Pregnancies linked together
– Convert typical visit to problem visit
– Graphical Partograph (matches WHO partograph)
– Patient Referral System
– Use of EDD/EGA calculation and update in display (with options for 
manual over-ride) – very useful automation for nurses
– Antenatal and Postnatal card generation (supports patient mobility)
– Infants linked to mother for each separate pregnancy
• Reports
• Problem Management including problems across multiple 
pregnancies
