B rief Overview 
 
The MOTECH Suite delivers an integrated set of complementary 
mHealth applications that are scalable, sustainable and readily 
deployed. The collaborative community of development organizations 
behind MOTECH Suite has provided an open-source platform 
addressing the core needs of mobile health, creating a widely-deployed 
mHealth platform across a wide range of geographies and health 
interventions.   
 
MOTECH Suite has been used by the Ghana Health Service to 
increase demand for antenatal care while simultaneously collecting 
service delivery information from community health workers. In six 
cities in India, MOTECH Suite is being used to provide care and 
treatment reminders to HIV-positive patients. In Bihar, India, BBC 
Media Action has developed services to increase frontline health 
workers communication skills and knowledge of life-saving maternal 
and child health behaviors. CARE also uses a MOTECH Suite system 
in Bihar to track pregnant women, mothers, and children under one along the continuum of care with specific 
protocols on birth preparedness, delivery, postnatal care, and exclusive breast feeding.  World Health 
Partners is extending timely, quality access to tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment to Bihar’s rural population.  
World Vision has deployed MOTECH Suite-based maternal, newborn, and child health services in Afghanistan, 
Mozambique, and Zambia and has plans for scaling to Sierra Leone, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zambia.   
 
MOTECH Suite comprises a set of complementary open source technologies from a consortium of partners, 
including Dimagi, Grameen Foundation, InSTEDD, OnMobile, ThoughtWorks, University of Southern Maine, 
and others.  The MOTECH Suite consortium has core funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as 
well as project-specific funding from Johnson & Johnson, Government of Norway, and USAID, among others.
