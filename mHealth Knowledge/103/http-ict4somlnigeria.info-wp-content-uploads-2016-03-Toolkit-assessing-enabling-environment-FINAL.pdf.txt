Introduction
The aim of this Over the last decade, governments, international donors 
toolkit is to provide and organizations have invested in innovative programs 
a systematic and and solutions that improve health outcomes and 
structured approach strengthen public health systems in low- and middle-
to assessing the income countries (LMICs). Digital health technologies, 
enabling environment an umbrella term reflecting the maturity and integration 
for digital health . of mobile health (mHealth) and electronic health 
(eHealth) technologies, have emerged as a critical part of 
health systems strengthening programs. There has been 
tremendous progress in establishing the evidence base 
for digital health technologies along with a supportive 
ecosystem of policy makers, technologists, donors, and 
public health professionals. 
To build on the growing momentum of scaled implementation of digital health 
tools, governments in LMICs require support to transition from an environment of 
isolated pilots and large-scale programs, to establishing national integrated digital 
health systems. This support includes assessing current environments, and using 
that context to develop pragmatic, evidence-based national strategies and frame-
works that provide an overarching vision and rationale for digital health, in addition 
to establishing policies that enable investments in key foundational elements.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Telecommunications 
Union (ITU) have developed a toolkit to guide countries through the process of 
establishing a national digital health vision, action plan and monitoring framework. 
The seven core components of the framework are leadership and governance; 
strategy and investment; legislation, policy and compliance; standards and interop-
erability; workforce; infrastructure, and services and applications (See Table 1).
Between 2012 and 2015, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) and the Federal 
Ministry of Communication Technology (FMCT) in the Government of Nigeria 
(GoN), in collaboration with the United Nations Foundation (UN Foundation), with 
support from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), used 
the WHO/ITU eHealth strategy toolkit to guide a three-phase assessment of the 
digital health environment. This process was designed to evaluate the current state 
of digital health in Nigeria, to ensure that the national digital health strategy built 
on existing efforts and was informed and grounded in sector realities.1 As part of this 
process, a set of assessment tools were developed and used to implement the various 
research phases. As more countries engage in the process of establishing, revising 
or revitalizing their national digital health strategies, these tools can be used and 
adapted to conduct baseline digital health assessments.

TARGET AUDIENCE
This toolkit is designed for governments as well as technical and implementing part-
ners and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) supporting LMICs to conduct a 
systematic assessment of the current state of its digital health system, using the experi-
ence of the GoN as the primary case study. Additional experiences from other LMICs 
have been included from secondary research and publically available information. 
The data collected from the activities outlined in this toolkit inform the development 
of an evidence-informed and pragmatic national digital health strategy. It is intended 
to compliment the WHO/ITU eHealth strategy toolkit, specifically in providing 
practical support to completing steps 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 in engaging with stakeholders, 
establishing the strategic context, learning from trends and experiences, gathering 
information on the digital health environment and assessing opportunities and gaps 
in the digital health environment. Technical working groups supporting the develop-
ment of national digital health strategies may want to reference this toolkit, use and/
or adapt the tools included to support their efforts.
TOOLKIT OVERVIEW
This toolkit outlines a three-phase framework for conducting an assessment of a 
country’s digital health system. This is followed by a description of each phase in the 
framework and its objectives and key activities. For each phase, tools are provided, 
which range from suggested qualitative interview questions to survey templates. These 
tools can be used as is or adapted for the specific context and/or the stage of maturity 
of a country’s digital health system. Guidance on how to use each of the tools is out-
lined. This toolkit consists of three parts:  
PART 1: An overview of the assessment framework 
PART 2:  A description of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the assessment framework, and 
an introduction to each of the tools, and their application

SECTION TITLE 13
A clearly articulated digital health strategy is essential 
to maximizing the impact of digital health technologies 
in LMICs. In the absence of a national strategy, digital 
health technologies risk being fragmented, small-scale, 
and short-term, minimizing the potential impact on 
improving health outcomes.
A sound national digital health strategy presents a set of interventions that a country’s 
health sector can use to guide priorities and facilitate the efficient and effective 
delivery of services using technology. Policies, information architectures, frameworks 
and guidelines for data and privacy standards, and a health information system (HIS) 
support a national digital health strategy.
In Nigeria, several enabling factors came together to set the stage for establishing 
and applying a systematic process to develop a national Health ICT strategic 
framework. This included: 
·  Strong government champions at the highest levels of leadership in the 
FMOH and FMCT: Dr. Mohammad Pate, Minister of State for Health and 
Mrs. Johnson, Minister of Communication Technology
·  Catalytic funding from a donor with a strong focus on innovation and 
mHealth: NORAD 
· A  neutral broker, invited by the FMOH, to facilitate the process: UN Foundation 
· A  critical mass of Health ICT implementations in the country leading to 
government interest in scaling select ones
·  Existing efforts by the government to develop Health ICT standards and 
policies, but realizing it required an overarching framework
This led to designing a three-phase assessment framework, in collaboration with the 
GoN, to inform the development of a National Health ICT Strategic Framework. The 
strategic framework aims to strengthen the enabling environment needed to facili-
tate the scale and sustainability of digital health technologies that would support the 
achievement of targeted health priorities namely reproductive, maternal, newborn, 
and child health (RMNCH) and Universal Health Coverage (UHC).
The goal of the assessment is to cultivate a deep understanding of the current 
utilization of digital health technologies in a country, and assess the social, cultural, 
technological, and political environments in which projects operate in, to establish 
requirements for strengthening the enabling environment. This includes identifying, 
understanding and addressing policy gaps, and introducing regulation by developing 
and advocating for the adoption of standards and guidelines, and addressing capac-
ity and training needs. In alignment with the WHO/ITU eHealth strategy toolkit, 
the assessment is designed to evaluate these needs across the seven foundational 
components of a national digital health strategy, namely leadership and governance; 
strategy and investment; legislation, policy and compliance; standards and interoper-
ability; workforce; infrastructure, and services and applications. 
The assessment consists of three phases: (1) a situational analysis, (2) an in-depth base-
line assessment and (3) a systematic application of the data. The first phase focuses on 
setting the stage for the assessment process by mapping the key stakeholders, programs 
14 PART 1: ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK
and objectives of the system, and articulating a clear rationale and vision for digital 
health in a country. The data from this phase is used to prepare a project proposal to 
initiate engagement with government stakeholders, donors, and partners. The second 
phase is geared towards collecting data through primary and secondary research on 
the current state of digital health in a country to directly inform the development of a 
national strategy. The third phase is aimed at sharing the data and recommendations 
with stakeholders for feedback and consensus building followed by charting a path for 
applying the data to drive decision-making and priority setting. Figure 1 outlines the 
key activities and data collected from each phase in the framework.

PART 1: ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK 15
“‘In order to know where you are going, you have to know where you have 
been and where you are...’ 
While cliche, it is extremely relevant 
and applicable to digital health. 
Comprehensively assessing the enabling 
environment serves as a compass. It not 
only allows us to identify existing health 
system goals, health system gaps and 
stakeholder needs and recommendations, 
it also uncovers barriers and opportunities 
for digital health that would otherwise 
go unrecognized. Through assessing the 
enabling environment, we are able to take 
an informed and educated approach to 
digital health, thus increasing our odds of 
success and impact on health outcomes.

RESEARCH APPROACH: 
Exploratory research 
The rapid diagnostic is a 2-4 week in-country activity led by researchers or program 
managers to gain a high-level understanding of the current state of digital health. 
This is followed by 2 weeks of synthesis and analysis, in order to prepare for an 
in-depth baseline assessment and strategic planning process. The rapid assessment 
allows an organization to introduce the intention of establishing a national digital 
health strategy to stakeholders, and gain inputs into designing a process that system-
atically takes into account a country’s context, constraints and national health system 
goals. Further, the rapid diagnostic helps identify key programs and platforms, early 
hypotheses on digital health opportunities (e.g., establishing a national HMIS) and 
challenges to validate through the in-depth baseline assessment.  
The process for developing a digital health strategy incorporates stakeholders 
from across the government, private sector, academia, international donor and 
development agencies. As a result, rapid diagnostics should be designed to include 
one-on-one and group interviews with stakeholders from each of these sectors. 
It is important to secure a senior government official as a champion to facilitate 
interviews with key stakeholders and serve as a sounding board as findings are ana-
lyzed and synthesized. The rapid diagnostic can take place over a 2-4 week period, 
depending on the nature of the relationship between the government and lead 
implementation partner. The lead implementation partner should plan to schedule 
interim meetings with government champion(s) to discuss real-time findings, and 
iterate questions or hypotheses appropriately. 
Following the completion of the rapid diagnostic, findings should be analyzed and 
synthesized into a report to use as part of the planning process and to begin mobiliz-
ing stakeholder engagement and support throughout the health system.

EXAMPLE: 
LEADING A RAPID DIAGNOSTIC IN NIGERIA
In 2013, two senior technical advisors were invited to conduct an initial diagnostic 
to set the stage for establishing a national Health ICT strategic framework as part of 
the GoN’s Saving One Million Lives (SOML) initiative.
The mission was led by the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) under the lead-
ership of the Minister of State for Health and launched in collaboration with the 
The rapid diagnostic led Federal Ministry of Communication Technology (FMCT). Utilizing a snowball 
to identification of early sampling methodology, government, international donors and development partner 
stakeholders were interviewed. The rapid diagnostic led to the identification of 
opportunities for scaling four digital health tools that had the political will, technology preparedness and 
digital health tools . potential impact quotient to introduce at scale.
High-level insights into the seven components of the WHO/ITU eHealth strategy 
toolkit were also assessed. Lastly, high-level challenges to scaling digital health 
programs were identified, and included limited digital technology capacity and 
know-how within the health system, weak standards and guidelines for utilizing 
data captured within digital health programs, and reliable network connectivity. 
These insights were fed into the design of the qualitative and quantitative surveys 
used for the in-depth baseline assessment. The two key outputs from this phase 
were a situational analysis report and a 3-page memorandum of the findings and 
recommendations to members of the GoN (i.e. Aide Memoire) which was critical for 
mobilizing support and stakeholder engagement for Phase 2 and Phase 3.

PART 2: OVERVIEW OF PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2 23
ACTIVITY 2: 
DEVELOP A ROADMAP AND 
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 
Findings from the rapid diagnostic are used to develop a roadmap that outlines the 
approach and planned outputs and outcomes from conducting an in-depth baseline 
assessment. This includes developing a project proposal to secure funding for the 
in-depth baseline assessment, outlining the key partners involved, and establishing 
a suggested timeline. 
To execute on the planned outcomes and outputs, a supportive organizational 
structure is established to drive efforts across the duration of the project plan. This 
organizational structure takes into account the diverse nature of digital health and 
therefore includes stakeholders across government departments, especially career 
civil servants, as well as partners and donors from the public and private health 
and technology sectors. Further, the leader of this organizational structure has a 
balanced view of the diverse needs required to introduce a national digital health 
strategy, such as broadband infrastructure and health outcomes research and can 
drive consensus and priority setting across these varying interests. Lastly, given the 
lengthy nature of developing a national digital health strategy, the organizational 
structure, specifically core committee members, are committed for the long term to 
ensure continuity across the process. However, the organizational structure also has 
the flexibility to adapt as the process unfolds and additional skillsets and advisory 
services are required.
Lead implementation partners advocating for the development of a national digital 
health strategy should plan to collaborate with government champions to design an 
organizational structure that includes a core steering committee to drive strategy, an 
advisory council to provide impartial advice and input, and relevant working groups 
to drive execution.

included: leadership and governance, standards and interoperability, workforce, 
infrastructure and services and applications. Lastly, a team of global experts sup-
ported the core team and working groups with technical and tacit knowledge from 
experiences setting up national digital health strategies in other LMICs.

EXAMPLE: 
SOUTH AFRICA’S eHEALTH STRATEGY 
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
In 2009, South Africa commenced the process of establishing its national eHealth 
strategy. This process was driven by the recognition that large investments into ICT 
and Health Information Systems (HIS) were not producing the data and infor-
mation to improve the management and monitoring and evaluation of its health 
system due to the lack of technology regulations and policy frameworks that enabled The environment was 
integration. The environment was fraught with a lack of an eHealth strategy and 
corresponding enterprise architecture, widely differing levels of eHealth maturity fraught with a lack of 
across and within provinces, disparate systems with little to no interoperability or an eHealth strategy 
communication, inequity in eHealth services provided and financing across prov-
inces and national health departments, an absence of a national master patient and corresponding 
index and unique patient identifier system, and limited capacity for implementation enterprise architecture .
in the public sector. In 2012, following several iterations, South Africa’s National 
Council of Health, National and Provincial Heads of Health, endorsed the national 
eHealth strategy. 
The National Department of Health (NDoH) and the National Health Information 
Systems Committee of South Africa (NHISSA) in collaboration with the Medical 
Research Council (MRC) and Provincial Departments of Health led the process. 
The team decided to not involve the private sector in the development of the eHealth 
strategy, preferring to establish a strong national framework on which to build more 
inclusive strategies on in the future.2 
An external review of South Africa’s eHealth strategy development process noted 
that the process benefited from the ongoing support of the chairperson of the 
NHISSA, but the engagement was limited to quarterly meetings, leading to long 
periods without engagement. The review also found that the process could have 
benefited from more formalized governance structures and mechanisms, including 
project plans and timelines.3
PART 2: OVERVIEW OF PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2 27
EXAMPLE 
CASE STUDY: DEVELOPING TANZANIA’S 2013-
2018 eHEALTH STRATEGY4
Between 2008-2009, the Tanzanian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) 
appointed a steering committee to oversee a participatory process to develop its 
national eHealth strategy. After five formal stakeholder meetings, and numerous 
informal and technical consultations, a draft eHealth strategy was developed. 
However, the MoHSW did not adopt the strategy. This setback led Tanzania to 
taking a revised approach in August 2012. The revised approach drew from various 
frameworks, including the WHO/ITU eHealth strategy toolkit, a Telehealth Strat-
egy Development Framework, the Business Motivation Model, and the Ishikawa 
Fishbone Diagram, to establish an eHealth strategy development framework unique 
to Tanzania. A core eHealth strategy development team was established, which 
included the MoHSW ICT, telehealth and health staff, and other eHealth and 
monitoring and evaluation advisors. The alternative eHealth strategy framework was 
established and applied through a 1-week workshop with follow-up discussions over 
a 12-month period.

28 PART 2: OVERVIEW OF PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2
The first two phases in Tanzania’s eHealth strategy development process shares 
similarities with Nigeria’s Health ICT strategic framework development process. 
The first phase in Tanzania included a desk review of existing policies including 
the Health Sector Strategic Plan III (HSSP III), and conducting informal interviews 
with senior management and health domain experts. This research ensured that 
the eHealth strategy was rooted in health sector priorities. The findings from the 
research were presented at a stakeholder workshop that led participants through a 
process to define the business goals, challenges and vision for eHealth in Tanzania, 
to determine how eHealth could support the achievement of health system goals. At 
the workshop, the eHealth visions and missions from select reference countries were The stakeholders 
reviewed. These reference countries included Canada and Australia as examples of engaged in the process 
mature eHealth strategies, and Kenya, Ghana and Rwanda, as examples of countries 
aiming to harmonize their respective eHealth strategies. The second phase of the found the approach 
eHealth strategy development process was an assessment of the strengths, weak- to be pragmatic and 
nesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of Tanzania’s key eHealth pillars. These appreciated seeing 
pillars included: foundation, solutions, change and adoption, and governance to 
understand Tanzania’s current eHealth environment. An eHealth gap analysis was immediate results .
also completed, which compared the “as-is” state with the “to-be” state, to ensure that 
gaps were well understood. In October 2013, the Government of Tanzania formally 
adopted the eHealth strategy. The participatory approach with key stakeholders 
involved in all stages of development led to national adoption and ownership of the 
eHealth strategy. An appraisal of the process found that the following skill sets were 
critical to achieving the desired outcome:
· Leading and facilitating participatory workshops
· C ollaborating with the Ministry and host country partners to identify  
key stakeholders 
· Understanding how ICT can transform the delivery of health services 
· T ranslating technology terms in accessible language to successfully engage 
with senior health leaders 
The stakeholders engaged in the process found the approach to be both systematic 
and pragmatic. Stakeholders appreciated the opportunity to see immediate results 
from their work through iterations of the eHealth strategy, which was found to be 
easy to understand and have clear linkages to national health priorities, and situa-
tional analysis findings. The full Tanzania eHealth strategy can be accessed here:

PART 2: OVERVIEW OF PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2 29
PHASE 2: 
IN-DEPTH BASELINE ASSESSMENT
Phase 2 of the assessment seeks to inform the develop-
ment of the national digital health strategy by collecting 
the data to establish a baseline to track future progress. 
THE KEY OBJECTIVES OF PHASE 2 ARE TO: 
· M ap the landscape of existing digital health technologies and programs to 
identify trends, gaps, and opportunities for scale 
·  Review existing in-country and international policies that enable digital 
health technologies and programs to identify strengths and gaps
· C onduct a field assessment across multiple levels of the health system to 
evaluate the environment and experience with digital health technologies, in 
addition to identifying key challenges and gaps 
· E stablish a baseline for the current digital health environment to use when 
measuring progress against the national digital health strategy 
To achieve these objectives, there are three key activities in Phase 2, including:
1 . Landscape and Inventory Analysis 
2 . Policy Review 
3 . Field Assessment

RESEARCH APPROACH: Desk Review Parameters 
Descriptive and Exploratory Research Database Fields
 
The landscape and inventory analysis is designed to assess trends, gaps and 
opportunities in the ICT infrastructure landscape, such as the scope of network 
availability and mobile phone penetration, and and map the digital health tools 
and interventions available across the country. This ensures that national digital 
health strategies build on existing efforts and infrastructure and supports pri-
oritizing interventions that will drive the achievement of health system goals. In 
addition, the analysis serves as a baseline to track and monitor the introduction, 
scale, and impact of digital health technologies for the duration of the national 
strategy and beyond. 
Given the fragmented nature of digital health technologies in most countries, 
the research approach is designed to capture and corroborate data from multiple 
sources to provide a comprehensive and accurate view of the environment. This 
includes conducting key informant interviews, reviewing peer-reviewed and grey lit-
erature from online databases , and crowdsourcing submissions through an online 
form. An online form is developed and used to crowd source submissions from the 
broader digital health community, supported by a living database that is updated 
annually to continue cataloging and tracking in-country digital health programs. 
As a part of the inventory process, each digital health program is evaluated against 
a criterion, and validated for being “active” through direct communication with the 
relevant organization. There are various types of digital health technologies and 
programs to consider in the landscape and inventory analysis, including govern-
ment systems, programs led by development partners and academic institutions, 
and private sector deployments.
PART 2: OVERVIEW OF PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2 31
EXAMPLE: 
CONDUCTING A LANDSCAPE AND INVENTORY 
ANALYSIS IN NIGERIA
Between March and September 2014, a landscape and inventory analysis of digital 
health tools in Nigeria was conducted to help prioritize interventions that would 
improve MNCH efforts, and serve as a baseline. Technology platforms and projects 
were evaluated across the six SOML target areas and the ten types of mHealth 
applications drawn from the WHO’s classification system. This framing provided 
the basis for analyzing the findings and making recommendations (See Tool on Page 
34 for more information).
The following search terms were used in five existing databases to identify relevant 
projects: “Information Communication Technology and Health”, “mHealth”, 
eHealth”, “Health Initiatives in Nigeria”, “ICT Health in Nigeria” and “ICT Initiatives 
in Medicine Nigeria”. The databases used were: Google Scholar, the WHO’s eHealth 
publications website, UNICEF, Health Market Innovations, and mHealth Info. A 
Google form was developed and sent to various stakeholders and online groups to 
serve as a living inventory to continue cataloging digital health projects in Nigeria.
The review identified 84 projects throughout the country. The data was analyzed 
to identify trends across key program areas (e.g. MNCH, nutrition, malaria etc.), 
geographic coverage, technologies (e.g. SMS, data application etc.), health system 
functions, and levels of scale, amongst others. The research helped uncover key 
challenges for for Nigeria’s health sector to consider. This included the need for sus-
tainable financing mechanisms to support investment in improved ICT infrastructure 
for reliable network coverage and ICT equipment, including mobile phones, tablets

not increased, emerged as a key recommendation to overcome resistance to adopting 
digital health technologies. Lastly, the lack of an overarching policy governing 
digital health, including client/patient security, standards and interoperability, and 
coordination to improve integration into national systems was found to be a challenge 
to scaling the digital health programs identified in the inventory. The findings were 
analyzed and synthesized into a report, which was shared with government and devel-
opment partners.

HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEM ASSESSMENT 
WORKSHOP IN SOUTH AFRICA
In March 2009, Statistics South Africa, in collaboration with the national, provincial, 
district and facility departments of health, the department of home affairs, the hos-
pital association of South Africa, the Medical Research Council, the World Health 
Organization Country Office and selected non-governmental, academic and private 
sector organizations, led a national workshop to assess the HIS in the country. 
The assessment was intended to provide a description and analysis of the state of HIS 
components, in addition to identifying strengths and weaknesses, gaps and oppor-
tunities, and barriers to using health information. Further, the assessment aimed to 
provide a baseline status of the country’s HIS to enable progress monitoring against 
the standards outlined in the Health Metrics Network (HMN) framework5 and 
promote a comprehensive understanding of HIS amongst all stakeholders. The data 
from this report was eventually used to inform the development of South Africa’s 
national eHealth strategy. 
The assessment adapted HMN’s assessment tool version 4.0 to suit South Africa’s 
HIS, followed by a selection of questions matched to eight stakeholder groups devel-
oped using HMN’s Group Builder Tool. Questions on chronic non-communicable 
diseases, which were not standard to the assessment tool, were also added. 
A two-day workshop was held with approximately 200 participants in attendance, 
all of whom received background information on the HMN framework and existing 
reviews of the HIS in South Africa. The eight groups scored six HIS components, 
as it applied to their expertise on a four-point scale from highly adequate to not 
adequate. The six components included: HIS resources, indicators, data sources, 
data management, information products, and dissemination and use. The findings 
from this assessment can be found at: http://goo.gl/8mTIzM

RESEARCH APPROACH: Sample Source Document List
Exploratory Research 
 
The policy review examines policies relevant to digital health to evaluate the nature 
of current legislation and regulations and identify gaps and needs. This exercise is 
critical to developing a national digital health strategy that is reflective of a country’s 
standing political landscape to ensure it builds on existing work rather than increas-
ing fragmentation or duplicating previous efforts. In addition, the policy review 
includes an analysis of digital health policies from select benchmark countries to 
highlight different approaches and draw from emerging best practices. 
In this activity, key informants are interviewed to map and explore the structure, 
interaction and role of the key entities in the health system and the information 
communication technology system. Source policy documents are identified through 
literature searches and recommendations from key informants. Analysis of the 
source documents is based on identifying the themes related to the WHO/ITU 
eHealth strategy toolkit, including leadership and governance, strategy and invest-
ment, legislation, policy and compliance, standards and interoperability, workforce, 
infrastructure and services and applications. Further, the analysis provides addi-
tional context on the country’s health system goals and priorities. 
Benchmark countries are chosen because: 1) their approach and structure has been 
recognized as exemplary by technical experts or 2) their approach to strengthening 
their enabling environment is relevant to the country and aligns in terms of geog-
raphy, demography and health indicators. Lastly, as part of the policy review, an 
evaluation of a country’s current stage of developing an enabling environment for 
digital health is conducted using the WHO/ITU eHealth strategy toolkit framework, 
which describes four stages: a) experimentation to early adoption, b) early adoption 
to developing and building up, c) developing and building up to scale-up, and d) 
scale-up to mainstreaming.
PART 2: OVERVIEW OF PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2 43
EXAMPLE: 
LEADING A POLICY REVIEW IN NIGERIA
A comprehensive review of existing digital health policies was led between May and 
September 2015 as part of the assessment process in Nigeria. Based on recommen-
dations by key informants, 13 policy documents were reviewed, of which 9 were 
reviewed in their entirety, and 4 had specific sections reviewed.
Seventeen key informants were interviewed to understand the relationship between the 
various health and ICT ministries, departments and agencies. These key informants 
included government agencies, international donors and implementing partners. 
Seven benchmark countries/regions were selected, based on their excellence in 
establishing an enabling environment for digital health and/or shared alignment 
with the Nigerian context in terms of economy, geography, demographics and 
health indicators. These seven countries/regions were: United Kingdom, Philip-
pines, European Union, South Africa, Ghana, Kenya and Rwanda. Each country/
region’s eHealth [digital health] strategy was reviewed to capture examples and 
best practices to learn and draw from. An evaluation of Nigeria’s current stage of 
developing an enabling environment for digital health found its in transition from 
“experimentation and early adoption” to “developing and building up.”
The review identified fragmentation amongst twelve relevant digital health policies 
and an absence of an overarching inter-ministerial governing body to lead imple-
mentation, resulting in weak coordination, communication and clearly delineated 
roles and responsibilities. This fragmentation was partly due to the lack of a national 
eHealth framework in Nigeria, which the initiative aimed to address. The review was

EXAMPLE: 
REVIEWING NATIONAL HEALTH PRIORITIES 
AND THE CURRENT EHEALTH CONTEXT IN THE 
PHILIPPINES
Between 2013 and 2014, the Department of Health (DoH) and the Department 
of Science and Technology (DoST) in the Philippines engaged in developing its 
eHealth strategic plan and framework, following a series of advocacy consultations 
by the ICT for Health Technical Working Group established in 2010, by Secretary of 
Health, Enrique Ona.6 The first step of its six-step process included a review of the 
countries national health priorities and current eHealth context.
The following documents were reviewed: 
· Universal Health Care or Kalusugan Pangkahalatan
· National Objectives of Health 2011-2016
· DOH Health Enterprise Architecture Version 1.0
· Philippine HIS Strategic Plan 2010-2016
· Information System Strategic Plan 2011-2013
· ICT4H Findings and Recommendations, 
· National HIS forum country commitments
The DoH had been actively applying ICT to improve health services and outcomes 
in the country, and learned important lessons during its experimentation phase. 
This led to increasing the development and scale of health information systems and 
investing in the enabling environment for digital health, including establishing and 
adopting standards. The Philippines had a strong enabling environment to draw 
from when it began to establish its strategic eHealth framework. For instance, the 
Philippines Health Information System 2010-2016 strategic plan outlined the key 
sources of health information in the country and outlined the eHealth vision, mis-
sion, strategic goals and objectives and priority focus areas. Further, the Philippine 
Council had undertaken significant eHealth initiatives for Health Research and 
Development under the DoST, including the Health Research and Development 
Information Network (HERDIN) and Philippine Electronic Health Information 
Village. The country is part of a strong regional network called the Asia eHealth 
Information Network (AeHIN). In October 2015, assessment tools developed in 
Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Lao and Myanmar, as part of their 
respective eHealth strategic development processes will be released, and available at: 
http://www.aehin.org/.

RESEARCH APPROACH: 
Descriptive Research 
 
The field assessment aims to take stock of the current status of select ICT components 
at each level of a country’s health system to validate findings from the landscape and 
inventory analysis and policy review, map the digital health capacity at different 
levels of the health system, and test the feasibility of scaling up select digital health 
tools. The ICT foundational components evaluated in the field assessment include:
·  INFRASTRUCTURE: The availability, source and support for ICT infrastruc-
ture (i.e. electricity and connectivity) and infostructure (i.e. computers, 
mobile phones, tablets etc.)
· S ERVICES AND APPLICATIONS: The types of digital health tools being 
used, and the availability and nature of support 
· W ORKFORCE: The availability of various health cadres, and status of digital 
health skills 
· S TANDARDS AND INTEROPERABILITY: The systems that support capturing, 
delivering, storing, analyzing and utilizing patient and service delivery data 
· S TRATEGY AND INVESTMENT: The availability and approval of budgets 
dedicated to investing in digital health tools and capacity building 
·  PLATFORMS FOR SCALE: The current status of prioritized digital health 
tools and platforms poised for national scale in a country 
The field assessment is structured to evaluate the current status of the ICT founda-
tional components from service delivery and health administration perspectives, 
recognizing that digital health tools require a coordinated systems-based approach 
to achieve scale, sustainability and utility. Service delivery includes surveying lead-
ership at healthcare institutions (i.e., clinics, hospitals), and health administration 
includes surveying leadership at government offices.
The geographical scope of the survey depends upon the resources available and the 
goals of the national government. However, to achieve an accurate depiction of the 
current status of ICT foundational components in the country, the scope is struc-
tured to understand regional differences across every level of the health system. This 
includes conducting health administration questionnaires at the federal/national, 
state and local level and service delivery questionnaires at primary, secondary and 
tertiary healthcare facilities. 
PART 2: OVERVIEW OF PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2 51
There are three key stages of the field assessment. The first stage focuses on planning 
for the field assessment, the second stage focuses on executing the field assessment, 
and the third stage focuses on analyzing and reporting on the findings from the field 
assessment. Each stage is described in further detail.
1. PRE-ASSESSMENT: PLANNING AND ORGANIZATION 
·  Design the scope, sample size, plan and timeline for executing the study. This 
may include identifying and contracting an agency with experienced field 
enumerators.  
·  Define the roles and responsibilities for the duration of the assessment 
· S ensitize key stakeholders at every level in the health system, introducing the 
aim and goals of the assessment and mobilizing buy-in 
·  Obtain necessary approvals from regulatory bodies at the national and state 
levels (e.g. national health research ethics board)8
· D evelop and test assessment tools
·  Set up and test database based on survey parameters to capture and store data 
·  Recruit, select and train research assistants, field enumerators, in addition to 
supervisors, and staff to perform telephone and email questionnaires, where 
required. A ratio of 1:4 supervisors to field enumerators is recommended 
·  Prepare field manual outlining assessment protocols, and lead 1-2 training(s) 
with all staff members to outline aims and objectives of the assessment and 
review assessment tools and field manual 
2. ASSESSMENT: DEPLOYMENT OF FIELD STAFF AND MONITORING 
·  Prepare for the study to take between six to ten weeks, depending on its scope 
· O rganize four levels of management to support the implementation of the 
assessment: 
›  LEAD TEAM oversees the study processes from design to data collection to 
reporting. 
›  FIELD ASSESSMENT CORE TEAM provides technical input to the study 
design, assessment tools, and recruitment and training of field staff. It also 
supports the provision of broader coordination and administrative support 
to team leaders and team supervisors during data collection, data cleaning 
and data analysis. 
› T EAM LEADERS support coordination and supervision of the study at various 
geographical locations (e.g. state). They provide second level data cleaning 
and validation services and are responsible for the collation of completed 
questionnaires and final dispatch to the field assessment core team. 
›  TEAM SUPERVISORS are directly responsible for managing a team of field 
enumerators, providing oversight to the face-to-face administration of 
questionnaires. They are also involved in data collection and data validation.
52 PART 2: OVERVIEW OF PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2
3. POST-ASSESSMENT: DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
· Data cleaning and validation is conducted at several levels.
›  TEAM LEADERS AND SUPERVISORS clean and validate data collected by 
their immediate teams before sending to the field core team. 
›  FIELD CORE TEAM conducts second level data cleaning and data validation 
before sending to data entry clerks. A final level of cleaning is conducted 
following the completion of data entry, by randomly selecting 10% of ques-
tionnaires and re-entering the data for validation. 
›  LEAD TEAM oversees the quality and accuracy of the data.
PART 2: OVERVIEW OF PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2 53
EXAMPLE: 
CONDUCTING A FIELD ASSESSMENT 
IN NIGERIA
A field assessment was led in Nigeria between December 2014 and February 2015, 
drawing from the Health Information Systems (HIS) assessment and readiness tools 
developed by the Health Metrics Network. The core team contracted a local research 
institution to lead the data collection efforts, which included the administration of 
questionnaires through face-to-face interviews, telephone and email correspondence.
The specific objectives of the field assessment were to: 
1 . A ssess the gap between the current status and full implementation of early 
digital health opportunities (i.e. NHMIS, mSCM, mCCT, and Demand 
Generation)
2 .  Map the health system’s current experience with digital health tools
3 .  Assess the current capacity and human resource needs for current and scaled 
implementation of digital health tools
4 . U se the data collected to set a baseline to monitor and evaluate digital health 
activities
5 .  Identify and assess digital health success factors for high performing states, 
local government areas (LGAs), facilities and users
6 .  Provide recommendations to support the scale up of digital health interven-

Phase 2 Field Assessment Findings
METHODOLOGY 
Face-to-face interviews were conducted with stakeholders at the federal government 
level in Abuja and at implementing partner’s head offices. To ensure coverage of 
the entire geo-political spread of Nigeria, and accurately represent the scope of the 
health system, one state per geo-political region was selected for in-depth interviews 
with representation of states with high, moderate, and low digital health activity. In 
addition, the state with the most digital health initiatives was chosen to allow for rich 
discussions on the strengths, weaknesses, gaps, and needs to scale up digital health 
tools. This data was referenced from the landscape and inventory analysis.
In each state, interviews were conducted with state-level stakeholders in addition 
to healthcare workers at the Local Government Area (LGA), the next level of gov-
ernment authority in Nigeria. One LGA per senatorial zone was chosen, for a total 
of 3 LGAs per state, with the exception of one state, where 4 LGAs were included. 
Finally, leadership was interviewed at the facility level. Seven facilities per LGA that 
represented a cross-section of those geographically located in urban and rural areas, 
and operated both publicly and privately, were chosen for a total of 126 facilities.

TOOL: 
SAMPLE QUESTIONNAIRES
The most important consideration when structuring the field assessment is to align 
the questionnaire across the various levels of the health system and be clear about 
whether the respondent is referring to health administration offices or service 
delivery facilities. Understanding the current status of support structures for digital 
health in both health administration offices and service delivery facilities is import-
ant to sustain the flow and feedback loops of health data captured through digital 
health tools.
The data collected in the field assessment provides a snapshot of the ICT and digital 
health environment across the health system, in order to identify key gaps and 
needs, and inform geographic priorities and planning. The following tool outlines 
sample questionnaires to use in the field assessment. Organizations leading field 
assessments are advised to adapt the questionnaire based on the structure of a coun-
tries health system, the goals of a countries national health plan, available resources 
to lead the field assessment, and the data captured from the landscape and inventory 
analysis and policy review.

74 PART 2: OVERVIEW OF PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2

“Most experts will agree that implementing 
health information systems in a single 
facility is an exercise fraught with 
problems. When we ask Ministries of 
Health to implement eHealth in all 
their clinics and hospitals at national 
scale, we are almost asking them to 
do the impossible. Yet that is what is 
required. When governments have a clear 
assessment of the enabling environment, 
they can readily identify areas of strength 
and weakness and systematically and 
incrementally address them until they 
reach their goals. We should thus provide 
these tools to our ministries to help them 
achieve their national eHealth strategies.

DATA APPLICATION
TIME: 6-12 months TOOLS: 
Sample Digital Health Vision 
RESOURCES REQUIRED: Sample Digital Health Theory of Change 
Government Leadership Sample Digital Health Information 
Program Managers Architecture 
Policy Analysts Sample Use Case 
RESEARCH APPROACH: Sample Mapping Assessment Data to 
Participatory Workshops Digital Health Recommendations
Conducting an in-depth baseline assessment that eval-
uates a country’s digital health environment, data is 
collected to support the development of a national digi-
tal health strategy that is grounded in and informed by 
current realities.
This process is designed to ensure that national digital health strategies are both 
visionary and practical, and will increase the likelihood of realizing the implementa-
tion of digital health tools and support structures.
The data collected in Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the assessment framework clarifies the 
gaps in the support systems and key priorities required to strengthen the enabling 
environment to introduce and adopt digital health tools at scale in a way that mean-
ingfully contributes to the achievement of national health goals. The data collected 
offers the opportunity for a country’s national digital health strategy to reflect and 
leverage existing efforts to maximize investments and resources.
Phase 3 of the assessment framework outlines how to use the data from the sit-
uational analysis and in-depth baseline assessment to inform the development 
of a digital health strategy, in alignment with the ICT foundational components 
recommended in the WHO/ITU eHealth strategy toolkit. This section describes six 
activities for bringing stakeholders together to collaboratively review and integrate 
the data into shaping the country’s national digital health vision, national health 
information architecture and theory of change, in alignment with national health 
system goals. Each activity is supported by an example from Nigeria’s experience in 
establishing its national Health ICT strategic framework.
78 PART 3: OVERVIEW OF PHASE 3
ACTIVITY 1: 
DEVELOP A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF 
NATIONAL HEALTH GOALS
Understanding a country’s national health goals sets the strategic context for dig-
ital health. Generally, clear, actionable goals for how a health system will improve 
outcomes are documented either in a long-term health plan, health system vision 
statement or health policy document. These goals often align with international 
initiatives, such as the Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Develop-
ment Goals. For instance, in Nigeria, the national health goals were outlined in its 
National Strategic Health Development Plan (NSHDP), Nigeria Vision 2020 and the 
(revised) National Health Policy, among other policy documents.
PART 3: OVERVIEW OF PHASE 3 79
ACTIVITY 2: 
ESTABLISH A DIGITAL HEALTH VISION 
AND THEORY OF CHANGE 
Drafting a national digital health vision is a collaborative effort amongst stakehold-
ers and representatives from government ministries, departments and agencies, 
donor organizations, development implementing partners, academic institutions 
and private sector partners. 
Stakeholders are brought together and facilitated through group and plenary discus-
sions to answer the following three questions: 
1 . What are the key health system priorities? 
2 . W hat are the strategic benefits and outcomes for the health system and popu-
lation that we want to see achieved? 
3 .  How can digital health support the achievement of the desired health outcomes? 
The responses to these questions are synthesized into a single vision statement, and 
form the basis to establish a comprehensive vision statement that outlines a country’s 
key health system goals, such as increased affordability and quality and improved 
health outcomes. Finally, the comprehensive vision statement is translated into a 
theory of change, outlining how each of the goals will be achieved. 
In Nigeria, over 50 stakeholders came together and worked in groups to answer the 
three questions. The exercise yielded a simplified and powerful vision for digital 
health in Nigeria: 
“By 2020, Health ICT will help enable and deliver Universal Health Coverage.” 
The same stakeholders then reviewed the vision statement in a plenary discussion. 
The resulting output was a comprehensive draft vision statement. With Nigeria’s 
health system facing significant financial and population pressures relating to cost, 
access, quality, accountability, and the integration of information and services, 
the comprehensive vision statement clarified why the adoption and use of digital 
health technologies within the health sector could help mitigate or eliminate these 
challenges. The vision articulated why digital health is critical to achieving UHC 
in Nigeria and improving the quality of, access to and meaningful use of health 
information and services throughout the country, especially amongst underserved 
populations in the most remote areas.

ACTIVITY 3: 
ESTABLISH A CONCEPTUAL NATIONAL HEALTH 
INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
The national digital health vision is shaped by drawing from both existing invest-
ments in digital health and plans for future investments. The development of a 
national health information architecture supports beginning the process of lever-
aging and integrating existing digital health platforms and tools. The architecture 
illustrates the government’s key digital health priorities, the types of data being 
collected, and its commitment to establishing an interoperable and secure system, to 
support service delivery across the health system. 
In Nigeria, as part of its Health ICT strategic framework, it established a national 
health information architecture, drawing from existing initiatives. The schematic 
outlines the key digital health initiatives and data collected by various government 
agencies, unified by an interoperability layer, and accessible through various access 
points such as mobile phones and hospital information systems.

ACTIVITY 4: 
DEVELOP A USE CASE TO ILLUSTRATE THE 
VISION IN PRACTICE
To illustrate the value and impact of a national digital health vision on a citizen’s 
life, developing use cases is an effective tool. The national digital health strategy 
document is used to gain continuous buy-in across stakeholder groups through the 
execution phases. Use cases illustrate the aspirations of an integrated digital health 
system and its impact on the patient experience and patient care. In Nigeria’s Health 
ICT strategic framework a use case was included that told the story of Fatima’s expe-
rience delivering her baby within Nigeria’s health system.
PART 3: OVERVIEW OF PHASE 3 85
TOOL: 
NIGERIA’S HEALTH ICT VISION IN PRACTICE
SCENARIO: THE HEALTH ICT VISION IN PRACTICE — IMPACT ON STAKEHOLDERS
A few months ago, Fatima registered her and her family in the NHIS* . Now, Fatima 
was expecting and due at any time . When she first learned that she was pregnant, she 
decided to sign up for weekly SMS* notifications about her pregnancy and to receive 
appointment reminders and pregnancy-care health information . When Fatima felt con-
tractions, her family members texted the local clinic and called a taxi . Fatima proceeded 
to the clinic .
Mary arrived at work right on time . She was excited for the day . During shift hand-over, 
she and her co-worker huddled over one of the clinic’s tablets going through the differ-
ent cases of clients present at the clinic . They prioritized the cases and she got to work . 
Shortly thereafter, Mary saw that a woman in labor was making her way to the clinic .
When Fatima arrived, she and her husband realized they had left the NHIS card at home 
in the hurry . But they were lucky, her NIN* was stored in her husband’s phone contact . 
With the cross-reference she was triaged . During her assessment of Fatima, Mary 
observed that the baby was in a breech position . When she had a break, she read up on 
breech deliveries using the clinic tablet . After reading, Mary decided to review Fati-
ma’s chart again through the EMR* system accessible using the tablet . Mary retrieved 
Fatima’s shared health record and learned that her first baby had been breech and did 
not survive . To be safe, Mary requested a brief consult with the obstetrics/gynecology 
department at the referral hospital . After speaking with the on-call physician, Mary was 
instructed to contact the physician through phone or videoconference if any complica-
tions arose . Mary felt confident going in to the delivery and provided support to Fatima .
After a successful delivery, Mary updated Fatima’s EMR, and updates were automati-
cally sent from the EMR system to the Civil Registration and Vital Statistics database, 
NHIS database for facility reimbursement, the facility’s LMIS* to account for supplies 
used during the birth and the NHMIS* for health services planning . The local govern-
ment M&E* officer was reviewing aggregate electronic NHMIS reports and supply 
requests from each of the LGAs*; he was pleased to see the decline in maternal and 
neonatal mortality continue .
Meanwhile, mum and baby were doing fine .

ACTIVITY 5: 
PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO STRENGTHEN 
THE ENABLING ENVIRONMENT
Strengthening each of the seven components of the digital health enabling environ-
ment is critical to realizing the implementation, scale and sustainability of specific 
digital health opportunities, to achieve national health system goals. The ICT 
foundational components from the WHO/ITU eHealth strategy toolkit organize 
the inputs and activities needed for digital health to support the achievement of 
health outcomes. Success of the health system is dependent upon the digital health 
environment and other structures being in optimal condition to address and fill 
gaps in service delivery, and quality of care. The assessment provides the data to 
outline the current state of each ICT foundational component, along with digital 
health opportunities and gaps that need to be addressed to achieve a country’s 
digital health vision, and health system goals.
The following table outlines examples from Nigeria’s mapping of the data captured 
from the assessment to recommendations included in the National Health ICT 
Strategic Framework.

ACTIVITY 6: 
ADAPT RECOMMENDATIONS INTO 
ACTIONABLE ACTIVITIES 
Using the theory of change, health information architecture and recommendations, 
a detailed action plan is developed to direct implementation and realize the coun-
try’s digital health vision. Each recommendation is translated into actionable and 
measurable steps that outline the process to its achievement, together producing a 
detailed action plan. The steps are organized into activities and sub-activities, with 
dependencies noted. Further, the persons or entities responsible for carrying out 
each of the activities is clearly defined in the plan. 
In Nigeria, a detailed action plan was developed based on the theory of change, 
which outlined the recommendations along a logical pathway of activities with short- 
and long-term impact. The activities in the action plan reflected a five-year process, 
separated into three phases. The phases were:
· PHASE 1: Set-up
· PHASE 2: Deployment
· PHASE 3: Maintenance and support
Set-up and preparation takes place in year 1. During years 2 and 3, activities that 
reflect deployment to help meet the vision are carried out. The final two years (years 
4 and 5) are focused on maintenance activities and progress reviews. Phase 1 was 
designed to be front-loaded, since important foundational structures and activities 
have to be established. Some activities are longitudinal and span the entire course of 
the timeframe, while others are more discrete. 
The detailed action plan includes the timeframe needed to meet or sustain each 
recommendation. Stakeholders in Nigeria believe that revisiting the action plan 
regularly is important to ensure continued alignment of the activities with achieving 
UHC. The National Council of Health, as owners of the Health ICT vision, will over-
see the action plan and receive support from the Health ICT Steering Committee, 
Technical Working Group and Project Management Office.
PART 3: OVERVIEW OF PHASE 3 91
CONCLUSION 
Information communication technologies are powerful and complimentary tools 
for public health systems in LMICS. Over the last decade, governments, donors, 
NGO partners, academic institutions and the private sector have experimented and 
expanded the use of digital health tools – including eHealth and mHealth tools – 
to improve access to quality care by creating content to increase the transfer and 
retention of information, and capture data to drive evidence-based priority-setting 
and decision making. The maturity of this environment has called for governments 
to establish national digital health strategies that paint a vision for the future and 
systematically create supportive structures for digital health tools to operate effec-
tively at scale. 
This toolkit has been designed to support governments and partners conduct a 
rigorous assessment to ensure that national digital health strategies are grounded in 
the realities of its countries health and ICT environments, and reflect both national 
health system goals and needs. Conducting this assessment produces both the data 
to develop an informed and pragmatic national digital health strategy, and a base-
line to use for ongoing monitoring and accountability. 
This work is drawn from the efforts led in Nigeria, in conjunction with the WHO/
ITU eHealth strategy toolkit. The FMOH and FMCT in Nigeria have been exem-
plary leaders in conducting a systematic assessment and approving a contextualized 
national Health ICT strategic framework, with a clear action plan for strengthening 
its digital health-enabling environment. Their experiences have enabled a process 
to emerge for other countries to learn from, and adopt where relevant. As illustrated 
by examples from South Africa, Tanzania and the Philippines, countries must adopt 
a process that is reflective of its capacity and and in alignment with the business pro-
cesses of its governance structures. In Nigeria, the core of its baseline assessment was 
its field assessment, whereas in other countries, it was large stakeholder workshops. 
We hope that by sharing our experience in supporting the GoN establish its Health 
ICT strategic framework, other LMICs can more easily navigate the complex, but 
important process of establishing a digital health strategy and support its continuous 
efforts in improving the quality of care and health outcomes for its citizens.
