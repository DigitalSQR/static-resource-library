What is DHIS2? DHIS2 Background
What is DHIS2?
After reading this chapter you will be able to understand:
• What is DHIS2 and what purpose it serves with respect to health information systems (HIS)?
• What are the major technological considerations when it comes to deploying DHIS2, and what
are the options are for extending DHIS2 with new modules?
• What is the difference between patient based and aggregate data?
• What are some of the benefits and challenges with using Free and Open Source Software
(FOSS) for HIS?
DHIS2 Background
DHIS2 is a tool for collection, validation, analysis, and presentation of aggregate and patient-based
statistical data, tailored (but not limited) to integrated health information management activities. It is a
generic tool rather than a pre-configured database application, with an open meta-data model and a
flexible user interface that allows the user to design the contents of a specific information system
without the need for programming. DHIS2 is a modular web-based software package built with free
and open source Java frameworks.
DHIS2 is open source software released under the BSD license and can be obtained at no cost. It
runs on any platform with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE 7 or higher) installed.
DHIS2 is developed by the Health Information Systems Programme (HISP) as an open and globally
distributed process with developers currently in India, Vietnam, Tanzania, Ireland, and Norway. The
development is coordinated by the University of Oslo with support from NORAD and other donors.
The DHIS2 software is used in more than 40 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and
countries that have adopted DHIS2 as their nation-wide HIS software include Kenya, Tanzania,
Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana, Liberia, and Bangladesh. A rapidly increasing number of countries and
organisations are starting up new deployments.
The documentation provided herewith, will attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of the
application. Given the abstract nature of the application, this manual will not serve as a complete step-
by-step guide of how to use the application in each and every circumstance, but rather will seek to
provide illustrations and examples of how DHIS2 can be implemented in a variety of situations through
generalized examples.
Before implementing DHIS2 in a new setting, we highly recommend reading the DHIS2
Implementation Guide (a separate manual from this one), also available at the main DHIS2 website.
Key features and purpose of DHIS2
The key features and purpose of DHIS2 can be summarised as follows:
• Provide a comprehensive data management solution based on data warehousing principles and
a modular structure which can easily be customised to the different requirements of a
management information system, supporting analysis at different levels of the organisational
hierarchy.
• Customisation and local adaptation through the user interface. No programming required to
start using DHIS2 in a new setting (country, region, district etc.).
• Provide data entry tools which can either be in the form of standard lists or tables, or can be
customised to replicate paper forms.
10
What is DHIS2? Use of DHIS2 in HIS: data collection, processing, interpretation, and analysis.
Provide different kinds of tools for data validation and improvement of data quality.
• 
• Provide easy to use - one-click reports with charts and tables for selected indicators or
summary reports using the design of the data collection tools. Allow for integration with popular
external report design tools (e.g. JasperReports) to add more custom or advanced reports.
• Flexible and dynamic (on-the-fly) data analysis in the analytics modules (i.e. GIS,
PivotTables,Data Visualizer, Event reports, etc).
• A user-specific dashboard for quick access to the relevant monitoring and evaluation tools
including indicator charts and links to favourite reports, maps and other key resources in the
system.
• Easy to use user-interfaces for metadata management e.g. for adding/editing datasets or health
facilities. No programming needed to set up the system in a new setting.
• Functionality to design and modify calculated indicator formulas.
• User management module for passwords, security, and fine-grained access control (user roles).
• Messages can be sent to system users for feedback and notifications. Messages can also be
delivered to email and SMS.
• Users can share and discuss their data in charts and reports using Interpretations, enabling an
active information-driven user community.
• Functionalities of export-import of data and metadata, supporting synchronisation of offline
installations as well as interoperability with other applications.
• Using the DHIS2 Web-API , allow for integration with external software and extension of the
core platform through the use of custom apps.
• Further modules can be developed and integrated as per user needs, either as part of the
DHIS2 portal user interface or a more loosely-coupled external application interacting through
the DHIS2 Web-API.
In summary, DHIS2 provides a comprehensive HIS solution for the reporting and analysis needs of
health information users at any level.
Use of DHIS2 in HIS: data collection, processing, interpretation, and analysis.
The wider context of HIS can be comprehensively described through the information cycle presented
in Figure 1.1 below. The information cycle pictorially depicts the different components, stages and
processes through which the data is collected, checked for quality, processed, analysed and used.
11
What is DHIS2? Use of DHIS2 in HIS: data collection, processing, interpretation, and analysis.
The health information cycle
DHIS2 supports the different facets of the information cycle including:
• Collecting data.
• Running quality checks.
• Data access at multiple levels.
• Reporting.
• Making graphs and maps and other forms of analysis.
• Enabling comparison across time (for example, previous months) and space (for example,
across facilities and districts).
• See trends (displaying data in time series to see their min and max levels).
As a first step, DHIS2 serves as a data collection, recording and compilation tool, and all data (be it in
numbers or text form) can be entered into it. Data entry can be done in lists of data elements or in
customised user defined forms which can be developed to mimic paper based forms in order to ease
the process of data entry.
As a next step, DHIS2 can be used to increase data quality. First, at the point of data entry, a check
can be made to see if data falls within acceptable range levels of minimum and maximum values for
any particular data element. Such checking, for example, can help to identify typing errors at the time
of data entry. Further, user can define various validation rules, and DHIS2 can run the data through
the validation rules to identify violations. These types of checks help to ensure that data entered into
the system is of good quality from the start, and can be improved by the people who are most familiar
with it.
12
What is DHIS2? Technical background
When data has been entered and verified, DHIS2 can help to make different kinds of reports. The first
kind are the routine reports that can be predefined, so that all those reports that need to be routine
generated can be done on a click of a button. Further, DHIS2 can help in the generation of analytical
reports through comparisons of for example indicators across facilities or over time. Graphs, maps,
reports and health profiles are among the outputs that DHIS2 can produce, and these should routinely
be produced, analysed, and acted upon by health managers.
Technical background
DHIS2 as a platform
DHIS2 can be perceived as a platform on several levels. First, the application database is designed
ground-up with flexibility in mind. Data structures such as data elements, organisation units, forms and
user roles can be defined completely freely through the application user interface. This makes it
possible for the system to be adapted to a multitude of locale contexts and use-cases. We have seen
that DHIS2 supports most major requirements for routine data capture and analysis emerging in
country implementations. It also makes it possible for DHIS2 to serve as management system for
domains such as logistics, labs and finance.
Second, due to the modular design of DHIS2 it can be extended with additional software modules or
through custom apps. These software modules/apps can live side by side with the core modules of
DHIS2 and can be integrated into the DHIS2 portal and menu system. This is a powerful feature as it
makes it possible to extend the system with extra functionality when needed, typically for country
specific requirements as earlier pointed out.
The downside of the software module extensibility is that it puts several constraints on the
development process. The developers creating the extra functionality are limited to the DHIS2
technology in terms of programming language and software frameworks, in addition to the constraints
put on the design of modules by the DHIS2 portal solution. Also, these modules must be included in
the DHIS2 software when the software is built and deployed on the web server, not dynamically during
run-time.
In order to overcome these limitations and achieve a looser coupling between the DHIS2 service layer
and additional software artefacts, a REST-based API has been developed as part of DHIS2. This Web
API complies with the rules of the REST architectural style. This implies that:
• The Web API provides a navigable and machine-readable interface to the complete DHIS2 data
model. For instance, one can access the full list of data elements, then navigate using the
provided URL to a particular data element of interest, then navigate using the provided URL to
the list of data sets which the data element is a member of.
• (Meta) Data is accessed through a uniform interface (URLs) using plain HTTP requests. There
are no fancy transport formats or protocols involved - just the well-tested, well-understood
HTTP protocol which is the main building block of the Web today. This implies that third-party
developers can develop software using the DHIS2 data model and data without knowing the
DHIS2 2specific technology or complying with the DHIS2 design constraints.
• All data including meta-data, reports, maps and charts, known as resources in REST
terminology, can be retrieved in most of the popular representation formats of the Web of today,
such as XML, JSON, PDF and PNG. These formats are widely supported in applications and
programming languages and gives third-party developers a wide range of implementation
options.
Understanding platform independence
All computers have an Operating System (OS) to manage it and the programs running it. The
operating system serves as the middle layer between the software application, such as DHIS2, and
13
What is DHIS2? Deployment strategies - online vs offline
the hardware, such as the CPU and RAM. DHIS2 runs on the Java Virtual Machine, and can therefore
run on any operating system which supports Java. Platform independence implies that the software
application can run on ANY OS - Windows, Linux, Macintosh etc. DHIS2 is platform independent and
thus can be used in many different contexts depending on the exact requirements of the operating
system to be used.
Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, since DHIS2 is a browser-based application, the only real
requirement to interact with the system is with a web browser. DHIS2 supports most web browsers,
although currently either Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Opera are recommended.
Deployment strategies - online vs offline
DHIS2 is a network enabled application and can be accessed over the Internet, a local intranet as well
as a locally installed system. The deployment alternatives for DHIS2 are in this chapter defined as i)
offline deployment ii) online deployment and iii) hybrid deployment. The meaning and differences will
be discussed in the following sections.
Offline Deployment
An off-line deployment implies that multiple standalone off-line instances are installed for end users,
typically at the district level. The system is maintained primarily by the end users/district health officers
who enters data and generate reports from the system running on their local server. The system will
also typically be maintained by a national super-user team who pay regular visits to the district
deployments. Data is moved upwards in the hierarchy by the end users producing data exchange files
which are sent electronically by email or physically by mail or personal travel. (Note that the brief
Internet connectivity required for sending emails does not qualify for being defined as on-line). This
style of deployment has the obvious benefit that it works when appropriate Internet connectivity is not
available. On the other side there are significant challenges with this style which are described in the
following section.
• Hardware: Running stand-alone systems requires advanced hardware in terms of servers and
reliable power supply to be installed, usually at district level, all over the country. This requires
appropriate funding for procurement and plan for long-term maintenance.
• Software platform: Local installs implies a significant need for maintenance. From experience,
the biggest challenge is viruses and other malware which tend to infect local installations in the
long-run. The main reason is that end users utilize memory sticks for transporting data
exchange files and documents between private computers, other workstations and the system
running the application. Keeping anti-virus software and operating system patches up to date in
an off-line environment are challenging and bad practices in terms of security are often adopted
by end users. The preferred way to overcome this issue is to run a dedicated server for the
application where no memory sticks are allowed and use an Linux based operating system
which is not as prone for virus infections as MS Windows.
• Software application: Being able to distribute new functionality and bug-fixes to the health
information software to users are essential for maintenance and improvement of the system.
Relying on the end users to perform software upgrades requires extensive training and a high
level of competence on their side as upgrading software applications might a technically
challenging task. Relying on a national super-user team to maintain the software implies a lot of
travelling.
• Database maintenance: A prerequisite for an efficient system is that all users enter data with a
standardized meta-data set (data elements, forms etc). As with the previous point about
software upgrades, distribution of changes to the meta-data set to numerous off-line
installations requires end user competence if the updates are sent electronically or a well-
organized super-user team. Failure to keep the meta-data set synchronized will lead to loss of
14
What is DHIS2? Deployment strategies - online vs offline
ability to move data from the districts and/or an inconsistent national database since the data
entered for instance at the district level will not be compatible with the data at the national level.
Online deployment
An on-line deployment implies that a single instance of the application is set up on a server connected
to the Internet. All users (clients) connect to the on-line central server over the Internet using a web
browser. This style of deployment is increasingly possible due to increased availability in (mobile)
Internet coverage globally, as well as readily available and cheap cloud-computing resources. These
developments make it possible to access on-line servers in even the most rural areas using mobile
Internet modems (also referred to as dongles).
This on-line deployment style has huge positive implications for the implementation process and
application maintenance compared to the traditional off-line standalone style:
• Hardware: Hardware requirements on the end-user side are limited to a reasonably modern
computer/laptop and Internet connectivity through a fixed line or a mobile modem. There is no
need for a specialized server for each user, any Internet enabled computer will be sufficient. A
server will be required for on-line deployments, but since there is only one (or several) servers
which need to be procured and maintained, this is significantly simpler (and cheaper) than
maintaining many separate servers is disparate locations. Given that cloud-computing
resources continue to steadily decrease in price while increasing in computational power,
setting up a powerful server in the cloud is far cheaper than procuring hardware.
• Software platform: The end users only need a web browser to connect to the on-line server.
All popular operating systems today are shipped with a web browser and there is no special
requirement on what type or version. This means that if severe problems such as virus
infections or software corruption occur one can always resort to re-formatting and installing the
computer operating system or obtain a new computer/laptop. The user can continue with data
entry where it was left and no data will be lost.
• Software application: The central server deployment style means that the application can be
upgraded and maintained in a centralized fashion. When new versions of the applications are
released with new features and bug-fixes it can be deployed to the single on-line server. All
changes will then be reflected on the client side the next time end users connect over the
Internet. This obviously has a huge positive impact for the process of improving the system as
new features can be distributed to users immediately, all users will be accessing the same
application version, and bugs and issues can be sorted out and deployed on-the-fly.
• Database maintenance: Similar to the previous point, changes to the meta-data can be done
on the on-line server in a centralized fashion and will automatically propagate to all clients next
time they connect to the server. This effectively removes the vast issues related to maintaining
an upgraded and standardized meta-data set related to the traditional off-line deployment style.
It is extremely convenient for instance during the initial database development phase and
during the annual database revision processes as end users will be accessing a consistent and
standardized database even when changes occur frequently.
This approach might be problematic in cases where Internet connectivity is volatile or missing in long
periods of time. DHIS2 however has certain features which requires Internet connectivity to be
available only part of the time for the system to work properly, such as offline data entry. In general
however, DHIS2 does require Internet connectivity of some sort, but this is increasingly an easy
problem to solve even in remote locations.
15
What is DHIS2? Deployment strategies - online vs offline
Hybrid deployment
From the discussion so far one realizes that the on-line deployment style is favourable over the off-line
style but requires decent Internet connectivity where it will be used. It is important to notice that the
mentioned styles can co-exist in a common deployment. It is perfectly feasible to have on-line as well
as off-line deployments within a single country. The general rule would be that districts and facilities
should access the system on-line over the Internet where sufficient Internet connectivity exist, and off-
line systems should be deployed to districts where this is not the case.
Defining decent Internet connectivity precisely is hard but as a rule of thumb the download speed
should be minimum 10 Kbyte/second for the client and at least 1 Mbit/sec (dedicated) bandwidth for
the server.
In this regard mobile Internet modems which can be connected to a computer or laptop and access
the mobile network is an extremely capable and feasible solution. Mobile Internet coverage is
increasing rapidly all over the world, often provide excellent connectivity at low prices and is a great
alternative to local networks and poorly maintained fixed Internet lines. Getting in contact with national
mobile network companies regarding post-paid subscriptions and potential large-order benefits can be
a worthwhile effort. The network coverage for each network operator in the relevant country should be
investigated when deciding which deployment approach to opt for as it might differ and cover different
parts of the country.
Server hosting
The on-line deployment approach raises the question of where and how to host the server which will
run the DHIS2 application. Typically there are several options:
1. Internal hosting within the Ministry of Health
2. Hosting within a government data centre
3. Hosting through an external hosting company
The main reason for choosing the first option is often political motivation for having “physical
ownership” of the database. This is perceived as important by many in order to “own” and control the
data. There is also a wish to build local capacity for server administration related to sustainability of
the project. This is often a donor-driven initiatives as it is perceived as a concrete and helpful mission.
Regarding the second option, some places a government data centre is constructed with a view to
promoting and improving the use and accessibility of public data. Another reason is that a proliferation
of internal server environments is very resource demanding and it is more effective to establish
centralized infrastructure and capacity.
Regarding external hosting there is lately a move towards outsourcing the operation and
administration of computer resources to an external provider, where those resources are accessed
over the network, popularly referred to as “cloud computing” or “software as a service”. Those
resources are typically accessed over the Internet using a web browser.
The primary goal for an on-line server deployment is provide long-term stable and high-performance
accessibility to the intended services. When deciding which option to choose for server environment
there are many aspects to consider:
1. Human capacity for server administration and operation. There must be human resources with
general skills in server administration and in the specific technologies used for the application
providing the services. Examples of such technologies are web servers and database
management platforms.
2. Reliable solutions for automated backups, including local off-server and remote backup.
16
What is DHIS2? Difference between Aggregated and Patient data in a HIS
Stable connectivity and high network bandwidth for traffic to and from the server.
3. 
4. Stable power supply including a backup solution.
5. Secure environment for the physical server regarding issues such as access, theft and fire.
6. Presence of a disaster recovery plan. This plan must contain a realistic strategy for making sure
that the service will be only suffering short down-times in the events of hardware failures,
network downtime and more.
7. Feasible, powerful and robust hardware.
All of these aspects must be covered in order to create an appropriate hosting environment. The
hardware requirement is deliberately put last since there is a clear tendency to give it too much
attention.
Looking back at the three main hosting options, experience from implementation missions in
developing countries suggests that all of the hosting aspects are rarely present in option one and two
at a feasible level. Reaching an acceptable level in all these aspects is challenging in terms of both
human resources and money, especially when compared to the cost of option three. It has the benefit
that is accommodates the mentioned political aspects and building local capacity for server
administration, on the other hand can this be provided for in alternative ways.
Option three - external hosting - has the benefit that it supports all of the mentioned hosting aspects at
a very affordable price. Several hosting providers - of virtual servers or software as a service - offer
reliable services for running most kinds of applications. Example of such providers are Linode and 
Amazon Web Services. Administration of such servers happens over a network connection, which
most often anyway is the case with local server administration. The physical location of the server in
this case becomes irrelevant as that such providers offer services in most parts of the world. This
solution is increasingly becoming the standard solution for hosting of application services. The aspect
of building local capacity for server administration is compatible with this option since a local ICT team
can be tasked with maintaining the externally hosted server, but with not being burdened with worrying
about power supply and bandwidth constraints which usually exist outside of major data centres.
An approach for combining the benefits of external hosting with the need for local hosting and physical
ownership is to use an external hosting provider for the primary transactional system, while mirroring
this server to a locally hosted non-critical server which is used for read-only purposes such as data
analysis and accessed over the intranet.
Difference between Aggregated and Patient data in a HIS
Patient data is data relating to a single patient, such as his/her diagnosis, name, age, earlier medical
history etc. This data is typically based on a single patient-health care worker interaction. For instance,
when a patient visits a health care clinic, a variety of details may be recorded, such as the patient's
temperature, their weight, and various blood tests. Should this patient be diagnosed as having
"Vitamin B 12 deficiency anaemia, unspecified" corresponding to ICD-10 code D51.9, this particular
interaction might eventually get recorded as an instance of "Anaemia" in an aggregate based system.
Patient based data is important when you want to track longitudinally the progress of a patient over
time. For example, if we want to track how a patient is adhering to and responding to the process of
TB treatment (typically taking place over 6-9 months), we would need patient based data.
17
What is DHIS2? Free and Open Source Software (FOSS): benefits and challenges
Aggregated data is the consolidation of data relating to multiple patients, and therefore cannot be
traced back to a specific patient. They are merely counts, such as incidences of Malaria, TB, or other
diseases. Typically, the routine data that a health facility deals with is this kind of aggregated statistics,
and is used for the generation of routine reports and indicators, and most importantly, strategic
planning within the health system. Aggregate data cannot provide the type of detailed information
which patient level data can, but is crucial for planning and guidance of the performance of health
systems.
In between the two you have case-based data, or anonymous "patient" data. A lot of details can be
collected about a specific health event without necessarily having to identify the patient it involved.
Inpatient or outpatient visits, a new case of cholera, a maternal death etc. are common use-cases
where one would like to collect a lot more detail that just adding to the total count of cases, or visits.
This data is often collected in line-listing type of forms, or in more detailed audit forms. It is different
from aggregate data in the sense that it contains many details about a specific event, whereas the
aggregate data would count how many events of a certain type, e.g. how many outpatient visits with
principal diagnosis "Malaria", or how many maternal deaths where the deceased did not attend ANC,
or how many cholera outbreaks for children under 5 years. In DHIS2 this data is collected through
programs of the type single event without registration.
Patient data is highly confidential and therefore must be protected so that no one other than doctors
can get it. When in paper, it must be properly stored in a secure place. For computers, patient data
needs secure systems with passwords, restrained access and audit logs.
Security concerns for aggregated data are not as crucial as for patient data, as it is usually impossible
to identify a particular person to a aggregate statistic . However, data can still be misused and
misinterpreted by others, and should not be distributed without adequate data dissemination policies in
place.
Free and Open Source Software (FOSS): benefits and challenges
Software carries the instructions that tell a computer how to operate. The human authored and human
readable form of those instructions is called source code. Before the computer can actually execute
the instructions, the source code must be translated into a machine readable (binary) format, called
the object code. All distributed software includes the object code, but FOSS makes the source code
available as well.
Proprietary software owners license their copyrighted object code to a user, which allows the user to
run the program. FOSS programs, on the other hand, license both the object and the source code,
permitting the user to run, modify and possibly redistribute the programs. With access to the source
code, the users have the freedom to run the program for any purpose, redistribute, probe, adapt, learn
from, customise the software to suit their needs, and release improvements to the public for the good
of the community. Hence, some FOSS is also known as free software, where “free” refers, first and
foremost, to the above freedoms rather than in the monetary sense of the word.
Within the public health sector, FOSS can potentially have a range of benefits, including:
• Lower costs as it does not involve paying for prohibitive license costs.
• Given the information needs for the health sector are constantly changing and evolving, there is
a need for the user to have the freedom to make the changes as per the user requirements.
This is often limited in proprietary systems.
18
What is DHIS2? Free and Open Source Software (FOSS): benefits and challenges
Access to source code to enable integration and interoperability. In the health sector
• 
interoperability between different software applications is becoming increasingly important,
meaning enabling two or more systems to communicate metadata and data. This work is a lot
easier, and sometimes dependent on the source code being available to the developers that
create the integration. This availability is often not possible in the case of proprietary software.
And when it is, it comes at a high cost and contractual obligations.
• FOSS applications like DHIS2 typically are supported by a global network of developers, and
thus have access to cutting edge research and development knowledge.

Using the Data Entry app About the Data Entry app
Using the Data Entry app
About the Data Entry app
The Data Entry app is where you manually enter aggregated data in DHIS2. You register data for an
organisation unit, a period, and a set of data elements (data set) at a time. A data set often
corresponds to a paper-based data collection tool. You configure the data sets in the Maintenance
app.
Note
If a data set has both a section form and a custom form, the system
displays the custom form during data entry. Users who enter data can't
select which form they want to use. In web-based data entry the order of
display preference is:
1. Custom form (if it exists)
2. Section form (if it exists)
3. Default form
Mobile devices do not support custom forms. In mobile-based data entry
the order of display preference is:
1. Section form (if it exists)
2. Default form
When you close an organisation unit, you can't register or edit data to this organisation unit in the Data
Entry app.
20
Using the Data Entry app Enter data in a data entry form
Enter data in a data entry form
1. Open the Data Entry app.
2. In the organisation unit tree to the left, select an organisation unit.
3. Select a Data set.
4. Select a Period.
The available periods are controlled by the period type of the data set (reporting frequency).
You can jump a year back or forward by clicking Prev year or Next year.
Note
Depending on how you've configured the data entry form, you might have to enter
additional information before you can open the date entry form. This can for
example be a project derived from a category combination.
5. Enter data in the data entry form.
◦ A green field means that the system has saved the value.
◦ A grey field means that the field is disabled and you can't enter a value. The cursor will
automatically jump to the next open field.
21
Using the Data Entry app Enter data in a data entry form
To move to the next field, press the Tab key or the Down Arrow key.
◦ 
◦ To move back to the previous field, press Shift+Tab or the Up Arrow key.
◦ If you type in an invalid value, for example a character in a field that only accepts
numeric values, you'll get a pop-up that explains the problem and the field will be
coloured yellow (not saved) until you have corrected the value.
◦ If you have defined a minimum maximum value range for the field and you enter a value
that is outside this range, you'll get a pop-up message that says the value is out of range.
The value remains unsaved until you've changed the value or updated the value range
and then re-entered the value.
6. When you've filled in the form, click Run validation in the top right corner or below the data
entry form.
All validation rules which involves data elements in the current data entry form (data set) are
then run against the new data. If there are no violations of the validation rules, you'll see a
message saying The data entry screen successfully passed validation. If there are validation
violations, they will be presented in a list.
7. (Optional) Correct validation violations.
Note
Zero (0) will delete the value if the data element has been configured to not store
zeros.

Enter data offline
The Data Entry app works even if you don't have a stable Internet connection during data entry. When
you don't have an internet connection, the data you enter is saved to your local computer. When the
Internet connection is back, the app will push the data to the server. The total bandwidth usage is
reduced since data entry forms no longer are retrieved from the server for each rendering.
Note
To use this functionality, you must login to the server while you've an
Internet connection.
• When you're connected to the Internet, the app displays this message at the top of the data
entry form:
• If your Internet connection breaks during data entry, the app detects it and displays this
message:
Now your data will be stored locally. You can continue to enter data as normal.
• Once you have entered all necessary data and the app detects that the Internet connection is
back, you'll see this message:
Click Upload to synchronize data with the server.
• When the data has successfully synchronized with the server, you'll see this confirmation
message:

Using the Data Entry app Enable multi-organisation unit data entry
Enable multi-organisation unit data entry
It can be useful to enter data for multiple organisation units in the same data entry form, for instance if
there are few data elements in the form and a huge number of organisation units in the hierarchy. In
that case, you can enable multi-organisation unit data entry.
Note
Multi-organisation unit data entry only works for section forms.
1. Open the System Settings app.
2. Select Enable multi-organisation unit forms.
3. In the Data Entry app, select the organisation unit immediately above the organisation unit you
want to enter data for in the organisation unit hierarchy.
Data elements will appear as columns and organisation units as rows in the form.
Note
The data entry forms should still be assigned to the facilities that you actually
enter data for, that is the organisation units now appearing in the form.

Control data quality About data quality checks
Control data quality
About data quality checks
The Data Quality app contains tools to validate the accuracy and reliability of the data in the system.
You can assess different dimensions of data quality as outlined in the table below:
Dimension Description
Correctness Data should be within the normal range for data
collected at that facility. There should be no gross
discrepancies when compared with data from related
data elements.
Completeness Data for all data elements for all reporting
organisation units should have been submitted.
Consistency Data should be consistent with data entered during
earlier months and years while allowing for changes
with reorganization, increased work load, etc. and
consistent with other similar facilities.
Timeliness All data from all reporting organisation units should
be submitted at the appointed time.
You can verify data quality in different ways, for example:
• At point of data entry, DHIS 2 can check the data entered to see if it falls within the minimum
maximum value ranges of that data element (based on all previous data registered).
• By defining validation rules, which can be run once the user has finished data entry. The user
can also check the entered data for a particular period and organization unit(s) against the
validation rules, and display the violations for these validation rules.
• By analysing data sets, that is, examine gaps in the data.
• By data triangulation, that is, comparing the same data or indicator from different sources.
Validation rule analysis
About validation rule analysis
A validation rule is based on an expression which defines a numeric relationship between data
element values. The expression forms a condition which should assert that certain logical criteria are
met.
The expression consist of:
• a left side
• a right side
• an operator
A validation rule could assert that "Suspected malaria cases tested" >= "Confirmed malaria cases".
The left and right sides must return numeric values.
The validation rule analysis tests validation rules against the data registered in the system. Validation
violations are reported when the condition defined in the validation rule expression is not met, which
means when the condition is false.
29
Control data quality Workflow
You can configure a validation rule analysis to automatically send out information about validation
violations to selected user groups. These messages are called validation notifications and you create
them in the Maintenance app. Validation notifications are sent via the internal DHIS 2 messaging
system.
Workflow
1. In the Maintenance app, create validation rules and validation rule groups.
2. (Optional) In the Maintenance app, create validation notifications.
3. Run the validation rule analysis, either automatically or manually.
◦ In the Scheduler app, you schedule the validation rule analysis to run automatically for
all validation rules included in one or several validation rule groups. After the system has
run the analysis, you'll see the validation violations (if any) in the validation notifications
sent via the internal DHIS 2 messaging system.
◦ In the Data Quality app, you run the validation rule analysis manually for selected
validation rules. After the analysis process has finished, you'll see a list of validation
violations (if any).
Schedule a validation rule analysis to run automatically
Note
Only validation rules that are included in one or several validation
notifications will be a part of the validation rule analysis. If there is no
corresponding validation notification for a validation rule, no notification will
be sent.
Note
While running validation rule analysis automatically, any results not already
persisted, will be persisted during this run. Persisted results can currently
only be accessed trough the API. Consult the developers guide for more
information about how persisted validation rule violations can be accessed.
1. Verify that you have created all the validation rules, validation rule groups and validation
notifications you need.
2. Open the Scheduler app and click the add button in the bottom right corner.
3. Choose a suitable Name for the new job.
4. Select the Monitoring Job type using the drop-down menu.
5. Select a running frequency for the job, i.e. when and how often the job should run.
6. Fill in the Parameters section, including the Validation rule groups.
7. Press the Add job button to confirm the job creation. For more information on adding jobs, see 
Scheduling.

Outlier detection
About outlier detection
The outlier detection tool identifies values which are numerically distant from the rest of the data,
potentially indicating that they are outliers. The analysis is based on the standard normal distribution.
DHIS 2 calculates the mean of all values for an organisation unit, data element, category option
combination and attribute option combination.
Note
As indicated above, this data quality analysis is only appropriate for data
which is normally distributed. Data with large seasonal variation, or which
may be distributed according to other statistical models (e.g. logistical ) may
lead values being flagged which actually should be considered valid. It is
therefore recommended to first confirm whether the data actually is
normally distributed before running a standard deviation outlier analysis.
32

Minimum maximum outlier detection
About minimum maximum value based outlier detection
You can verify the data quality at the point of data entry by setting a minimun/maximum value range
for each data value. You can define the value ranges manually or generate them automatically.
The auto-generated minimum maximum value range is suitable only for normally distributed data.
DHIS2 will determine the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of all values for a given data
element, category option, organisation unit and attribute combination. Then the system will calculate
the minimum maximum value range based on the Data analysis std dev factor specified in the 
System Settings app.
For data which is highly-skewed or zero inflated (as is often the case with aggregate data), the values
which DHIS2 auto-generates may not provide an accurate minimum maximum value range. This can
lead to excessive false violations, for example if you analyse values related to seasonal diseases.
Note
Minimum maximum value ranges are calculated across all attribute
combination options for a given data element, category option and
organisation unit combination.
34
Control data quality Workflow
Workflow
1. Create a minimum maximum value range, either automatically or manually.
◦ In the Data Administration app, you generate value ranges automatically.

Configure a minimum maximum outlier detection
Create minimum maximum value range automatically
Note
Auto-generated minimum maximum value ranges can be useful for many
situations, but it's recommended to verify that the data is actually normally
distributed prior to using this function.
You generate minimum maximum value ranges calculated by data set in the Data Administration
app. The new value ranges override any value ranges that the system has calculated previously.
1. Set the Data analysis standard deviation (std dev) factor:
1. Open the System Settings app, and click General.
2. In the Data analysis std dev factor field, enter a value.
This sets the number of standard deviations to use in the outlier analysis. The default
value is 2. Higher values indicate a broader distribution, which may lead to outliers not
being flagged correctly by the analysis.
2. Open the Data Administration app and click Min-max value generation.
3. Select data set(s).
4. Select an Organisation unit.

About the Capture app
Note
The Capture app serves as a replacement for the Event Capture app. In the
future, the Tracker Capture app and the Data Entry app will also be
incorporated into the Capture app.
In the Capture app you register events that occurred at a particular time and place. An event can
happen at any given point in time. This stands in contrast to routine data, which is captured for
predefined, regular intervals. Events are sometimes called cases or records. In DHIS2, events are
linked to a program. The Capture app lets you select the organisation unit and program and specify a
date when an event happened, before entering information for the event.
Register an event
1. Open the Capture app.
2. Select an organisation unit.
3. Select a program.
You will only see programs associated with the selected organisation unit and programs you
have access to, and that are shared with your user group through data level sharing.
4. If the program has a category combination set the category option will have to be selected.
5. Click New.
create new event
6. Fill in the required information. If the programs program stage is configured to capture a
location:
◦ If the field is a coordinate field you can either enter the coordinates directly or you can
click the map icon to the left of the coordinate field. The latter one will open a map where
you can search for a location or set on directly by clicking on the map.
◦ If the field is a polygon field you can click the map icon to the left of the field. This will
open a map where you can search for a location and capture a polygon (button in the
upper right corner of the map).
7. If desired you can add a comment by clicking the Write comment button at the bottom of the

you have captured will be displayed in a list at the bottom of the page. When you want to
finish capturing events you can, if the form is blank, click the finish button or if your form
contains data click the arrow next to Save and add another and select Save and exit.
Note
Some data elements in an event might be mandatory (marked with a red
star next to the data element label). All mandatory data elements must be
filled in before the user is allowed to complete the event. The exception to
this is if the user has the authority called "Ignore validation of required
fields in Tracker and Event Capture". If the user has this authority, the
mandatory data elements will not be required and the red star will not be
displayed next to the data element label. Note that super user that have the
"ALL" authority automatically have this authority.
Tip
The data entry form can also be displayed in row view. In this mode the
data elements are arranged horizontally. This can be achieved by clicking
the Switch to row view button on the top right of the data entry form. If you
are currently in row view you can switch to the default form view by clicking

8. You will now be prompted to the tracked entity instance dashboard.
The dashboard will show relevant information about the newly created tracked entity instance.
Note
Some data elements in an event might be mandatory (marked with a red
star next to the data element label). All mandatory data elements must be
filled in before the user is allowed to complete the event. The exception to
this is if the user has the authority called "Ignore validation of required
fields in Tracker and Event Capture". If the user has this authority, the
mandatory data elements will not be required and the red star will not be
displayed next to the data element label. Note that super user that have the
"ALL" authority automatically have this authority.
45
Using the Capture app Enrollment with auto generated events
Tip
The data entry form can also be displayed in row view. In this mode the
data elements are arranged horizontally. This can be achieved by clicking
the Switch to row view button on the top right of the data entry form. If you
are currently in row view you can switch to the default form view by clicking
the Switch to form view button on the top right of the data entry form.
Enrollment with auto generated events
A program can be configured to have zero or more program stages which are automatically generated
upon a new enrollment. These stages will be auto generated based on the metadata configuration, as
explained below.
To configure the auto generation of an event you need to take the following steps.
1. Open the maintenance app
2. Select the Program tab 
3. Select a Tracker program 
46
Using the Capture app Enrollment with auto generated events
Select the Program stages tab 
4. 
5. Click on the stage you would like to configure 
47
Using the Capture app Enrollment with auto generated events
Mark the stage as Auto-generated 
6. 
Now, for every new enrollment in this program one event will be auto generated. One program can
also have multiple stages marked as auto generated. For all the auto generated events
a) the organisation unit will be the same as the user is reporting for, during the enrollment and
b) all the events will be part of the current enrollment.
Based on configuration, the status of the auto generated event can either be ACTIVE or SCHEDULE.
48
Using the Capture app Enrollment with auto generated events
Active type of event
If the stage has the "Open data entry form after enrollment" selected, then the event will be generated
into the ACTIVE status. Also its execution date will be calculated for the event, in addition to a due
date. The generation happens based on either the enrollment date or the incident date. You can
choose the reporting date from the dropdown menu "Report date to use". 
As shown in the image you have three options, a) Incident date b) Enrollment date or c) No value.
Choosing reporting date as "Incident date" indicates that both the event execution date and due date
will be the same as the incident date. Choosing reporting date as either "Enrollment date" or "No
value" indicates that both the event execution date and due date will be the same as the enrollment
date.
Schedule type of event
When the "Open data entry after enrollment" is not checked, it means that the event generated will be
a SCHEDULE event. The scheduled event does not have an execution date, but only a due date. The
due date for these future events are calculated based on either enrollment date or incident date. If the
flag below is checked, the reference date is the enrollment date, if the flag is not checked, the incident
date is used. 
49
Using the Capture app Possible duplicates detection
When there is no incident date, the reference date will fall back on the enrollment date regardless of
whether the flag above is checked.
On SCHEDULE type of events the user can also configure the "Scheduled days from start". Which
means if a stage has a number in "Scheduled days from start" the reference date will increased by
that number. In the example below we increase the due date by 30 days.
When the "Scheduled days from start" does not contain a number or contains 0 the reference date is
used without adding any days to it.
Possible duplicates detection
In both cases of registering a tracked entity instance, (with enrollment or without enrollment) the
system will start looking for possible duplicates. Note that, programs need to be correctly configured
through the maintenance app for the system to start detecting duplicates when enrolling a new person
in a program.
50
Using the Capture app Possible duplicates detection
To configure a program through the maintenance app you will have to:
1. Open the maintenance app. 
2. In the program section select your program. We select Child Programme for this example. 
51
Using the Capture app Possible duplicates detection
Select the Attributes tab. 
3. 
4. Enable duplicates search by checking program attributes as searchable 
The attributes you have selected as "Searchable" will be the ones which the system will use to detect
possible duplicates against.
52
Using the Capture app Possible duplicates detection
Let us explain this with an example that demonstrates the detection of possible duplicates while
enrolling a child in the Child Programme.
1. Open the Capture app. 
2. Select your organisation unit and program from the menu on the top. 
3. Click "New" -> "New person in Child Programme" 
53
Using the Capture app Possible duplicates detection
Fill in the first name in the form. Remember, the first name we have checked as
4. 
"Searchable" in the maintenance app. Click Save new. The system will start looking for
possible duplicates that match the name Sarah. 
5. The system will automatically show a list of possible duplicates if there are any. 
54
Using the Capture app Program rules execution
You can choose to make a new enrollement by clicking Save new or if you see the right person
6. 
in the list - you can view the dashboard. 
Tip
You can configure duplicates detection for tracked entity types the same
way as we did for programs.
Program rules execution
In both cases of registering a tracked entity instance, (with enrollment or without enrollment) the
system will run program rules you have configured. Note that, rules can be configured in the
maintenance app.
To see a rule being executed while enrolling a tracked entity instance you will have to take the
following steps.
1. Configure a rule in the maintenance app. For the example below we configured a rule that
throws a warning when the date of birth is less than a year.
2. Open the Capture app. 
55
Using the Capture app Program rules execution
Select your organisation unit and program from the menu on the top. 
3.

◦ If the Tracked Entity Instance or program is configured with a unique attribute, this
attribute can be used for finding a specific Tracked Entity Instance or program. This
attribute should be presented alone. When the unique attribute field has been filled out,
click the Search button located right below the unique attribute field.
◦ If the Tracked Entity Instance or program has attibutes these can be used for
searching by expanding the Search by attributes box. When all desired attribute fields
have been filled out, click the Search by attributes button located at the bottom. You
can also limit the search by setting the Organisation unit scope. If set to All accessible
you will search for the Tracked Entity Instance in all organisation units you have access
to. If you select Selected, you will be asked to select which organisation units to search
within.
3. After a successful search you will be presented with a list of Tracked Entity Instances
matching the search criteria. To create a relationship click the Link button on the Tracked
Entity Instance you would like to create a relationship to.
4. If you did not find the Tracked Entity Instance you were looking for, you can either click the 
New search or Edit search buttons. New search will take you to new blank search while Edit
search will take you back to the search you just performed keeping the search criteria.

Metadata caching
For performance reasons the Capture app caches metadata in the client browser. When metadata is
updated on the server the changes needs to be propagated to the clients that have already cached the
metadata. Depending on the change, this is done in one of three ways:
1. If the change is bound to a program you will need to increase the program version for that
particular program. For example, if you change the data elements in a program or a program
rule, the version for the bound program needs be increased.
2. If the change is NOT bound to a program you will need to increase ANY program version for the
change to be propagated to the clients. Examples here are changes to constants, organisation
unit levels or organisation unit groups.
3. The exception to the two rules above is option sets. Option sets have their own version
property, i.e. increasing the option set version should ensure the option set metadata are
propagated to the clients.
Enrollment dashboard
Reaching the enrollment dashboard via url
You reach the enrollment dashboard either by typing in the address bar of your browser or using the
user interface of the capture app. In this section we are focusing on the first use-case, where you type
or paste the url you want to access in the Address bar.
79
Using the Capture app Reaching the enrollment dashboard via url
One way to reach the enrollment dashboard and view a specific tracked entity instance's enrollment is
by using only the enrollment id. For example the link .../dhis-web-capture/#/enrollment?
enrollmentId=wBU0RAsYjKE will take you the dashboard for the enrollment with id wBU0RAsYjKE.
The top of the dashboard defines your context. For example in the image below the context is as
follows, the selected program is "Child Programme", the organisation unit is "Ngelehun CHC", the
selected person is "Anna Jones" and the selected enrollment is "2017-11-16 11:38".
You can change your context by clicking the "x" button.

About the Event Capture app
In the Event Capture app you register events that occurred at a particular time and place. An event
can happen at any given point in time. This stands in contrast to routine data, which can be captured
for predefined, regular intervals. Events are sometimes called cases or records. In DHIS2, events are
linked to a program. The Event Capture app lets you select the organisation unit and program and
specify a date when a event happened, before entering information for the event.
The Event Capture app works online and offline. If the Internet connectivity drops, you can continue
to capture events. The events will be stored locally in your web browser (client). When connectivity
has returned, the system will ask you to upload the locally stored data. The system then sends the
data to the server where the data is stored.
Note
If you close the web browser while in offline mode, it is not possible to
reopen a new web browser window and continue the working session.
However the data will still be saved locally and can be uploaded to the
server the next time the machine is online and the you have logged into the
server.
• You only see programs associated with the organisation unit you've selected and programs
you've access to view through your user role.
• Both skip-logic and validation error/warning messages are supported during registration.
• When you close an organisation unit, you can't register or edit events to this organisation unit in
the Event Capture app. You can still view and filter the event list and view the details of an
event.
• On-the-fly indicator expression evaluation is supported. If a program has indicators defined for it
and the moment all values related to the indicator expression are filled, the system will calculate
indicator and display the result.

Using the Event Capture app Register an event
• Sorting: this can be done by clicking the sorting icon of each column header. A red sorting icon
implies the current sorting column. However, the sorting functionality works only within the page
displayed. Currently, it is not possible to do sorting from serverside.
• Filtering: this is done by clicking the small search icon shown to the right of each column
header. Clicking them provides an input field to type a filtering criteria. The system starts
applying the filter the moment a user starts to type. During filtering it is possible to define start
and end dates for date type data elements and lower and upper limits for number types. Server
side filtering is not-support at the moment.

About the Tracker Capture app
The Tracker Capture app is an advanced version of the Event Capture app.
• Event Capture: handles single events without registration
• Tracker Capture: handles multiple events (including single event) with registration.
• You capture event data for a registered tracked entity instance (TEI).
• You only see programs associated with the organisation unit you've selected and programs
you've access to view through your user role.
• The options you see in the search and register functions depend on the program you've
selected. The program attributes control these options. The attributes also decide the columns
names in the TEI list.
If you don't select a program, the system picks default attributes.
• Both skip-logic and validation error/warning messages are supported during registration.
• When you close an organisation unit, you can't register or edit events to this organisation unit in
the Tracker Capture app. You can still search for TEIs and filter the search results. You can
also view the dashboard of a particular TEI.
103
Using the Tracker Capture app About tracked entity instance (TEI) dashboards
About tracked entity instance (TEI) dashboards
You manage a TEI from the TEI's dashboard in the Tracker Capture app.
• The dashboard consist of widgets. Drag and drop the widgets to place them in the order and in
the position you want.
• Click the pin icon to stick the right column of widgets to a fix position. This is useful especially
during data entry.
If you have many data elements or big form to fill in, stick the right widget column. Then all the
widgets you've placed in the right column remain visible while you scroll in the data entry part.
• Any indicator defined for the program you've selected will have its value calculated and
displayed in the Indicators widget.
• Navigation:
◦ Back: takes you back to the search and registration page
◦ Previous and next buttons: takes you to the previous or next TEI dashboard in the TEI
search results list
◦ Other programs field: if the TEI is enrolled in other programs, they're listed here. Click a
program to change the program for which you enter data for the selected TEI. When you
change programs, the content in the widgets change too.

Lists can also be downloaded or printed.
Custom predefined lists
If the program has any custom tracked entity filters associated with it, these will take the place of the
four predefined lists mentioned above. The predefined lists will when well configured be an effective
way to find or work with the data relevant for the user in that program.
Working lists can be defined with a wide variety of options, here are some examples:
• Display all TEIs with at least one event in a given program stage that
• has a due date on the current date.
• Display all TEIs that has at least one event that is assigned to the
• logged in user.
• Display all TEIs that is active, but is not assigned to any user.
109
Using the Tracker Capture app Search
Predefined working lists in tracker capture
See the API documentation for a full list of functionality supported for these predefined tracked entity
instance filters.
Search
Search is used to search for TEIs in the organisation units the user has search access to. This can be
used if you want to find a TEI, but you don't know which organisation unit or program the TEI was
enrolled in. There are two ways of doing this: With and without a program context. Searchable fields
needs to be configured. For configuring searching with program context, this is done individually for
each program in the program maintenance app. For configuring searching without a program context,
this is done individually for each tracked entity type in the tracked entity type maintenance app.
Searching without a program context:
1. Open Tracker Capture app
2. Click the Search button
3. Searchable fields will be displayed in groups. Unique attributes is only individually searchable.
Non-unique attributes can be combined.
4. Fill in search criteria and click the search icon button.
Searching with a program context:

5. Searchable fields will be displayed in groups. Unique attributes is only individually searchable.
Non-unique attributes can be combined.
6. Fill in search criteria and click the search icon button
110
Using the Tracker Capture app Search
After the search has been done, you will be presented with the search result. Whats displayed
depends on the outcome of the search.
For unique attribute search:
• If no matching TEI found, you will get the possibility to open the registration form.
• If the TEI was found in the selected organisation unit, the TEI dashboard will automatically
open.
• If the TEI was found in outside the selected organisation unit, you will get the possibility to open
the TEI.
For non-unique attributes search:
• If no matching TEI's found, you will get the possibility to open the registration form.
• If matching TEI's found, you can either click on any TEI in the result list, or open the registration
form.
• If a too large number of matches was found, you will be prompted to refine your search criteria
111
Using the Tracker Capture app Flagging tracked entity instance as potential duplicate
The search results have functionality for flagging tracked entity instances as possible duplicates, see
next chapter.
When choosing to open the registration form, the search values will automatically be filled into the
registration form.
Flagging tracked entity instance as potential duplicate
When searching for tracked entity instances in the tracker capture app, the user will sometimes
suspect that one or more of the search hits are duplicates of other tracked entity instances. The user
has the option of clicking on the flag possible duplicate link in the rightmost column of the search
result grid.
Tracked entity instances flagged in this way will be marked as "possible duplicate" in the DHIS2
database. The flag indicates that the tracked entity instance is/has a duplicate. The presence of such a
flag is visible to the user in two places. One is the result list itself (in this example Mark Robinson is
already flagged as a potential duplicate):
112
Using the Tracker Capture app Flagging tracked entity instance as potential duplicate
Tracker capture search results
The other place is within the tracked entity instance dashboard:
113
Using the Tracker Capture app Breaking the glass
Tracked entity instance flagged as duplicate
In addition to informing users about the tracked entity instance potentially being a duplicate, the flag
will be used by the underlying system for finding and merging duplicates in coming versions of DHIS2.
Breaking the glass
If the program is configured with access level protected, and the user searches and finds tracked
entity instances that is owned by organisation unit that the user does not have data capture authority
for, the user is presented with the option of breaking the glass. The user will give a reason for breaking
the glass, then gain temporary ownership of the tracked entity instance.

Enter event data for a TEI
Widgets for data entry
In a TEI dashboard, you enter event data in the Timeline Data entry or Tabular data entry widgets.
Data entry widgets in the Tracker Capture app
114
Using the Tracker Capture app Creating an event
Widget name Description
Timeline Data entry For data entry using either default or custom forms.
Depending on program definition, in particular
program stages, events will be displayed in a timely
fashion. Clicking on any of them displays the
corresponding data entry. If a stage needs new
event, a plus icon is displayed for new event
creation. To proceed with data entry, it is mandatory
to have event date. Once an event date is specified it
is not possible to change due date. The assumption
is that by specifying event date, the event has
already taken place. If the event hasn't occurred yet,
it is possible to change due date - this is effectively
doing nothing but rescheduling. The buttons at the
bottom help to change the status of a selected event.
Another key feature from this widget is addition of
multiple notes for an event. Normally data recording
is through data elements, however there are cases
where it is necessary to record additional information
or comments. This is where the notes section comes
handy. However it is not possible to delete a note.
The idea is notes are more like log books. Both skip-
logic and validation error/warning messages are
supported during data entry.
Also included in the Timeline Data entry is the option
to compare your data entry to previous entries. This
can be enabled by clicking the "Switch to compare
form" button (Two sheets of paper) in the top right
corner of the Timeline Data entry widget.
Tabular data entry For tabular-style data entry.
The widget displays the list of program stages as
left-hand side labels. Events will be listed in table for
repeatable program stage, and allows for in-line edits
of event data values.
Creating an event
You can create an event for a TEI by:
1. Open the Tracker Capture app.
2. Open an existing TEI dashboard.
3. In the Timeline Data entry or Tabular data entry widget, click the +-button.
4. Select a Program stage and set a Report date.
Program stages can be configured to use a feature type. This makes it possible to capture
geometry for an event. Supported feature type is Point and Polygon. Please see How to use
geometry.
115
Using the Tracker Capture app Schedule an event
Click Save.
5. 
Schedule an event
You can schedule an event for a future date by:

4. Select a Program stage and set a Schedule date.
5. Click Save.
Refer an event
Sometimes it might be necessary to refer a patient to a different Organisation unit. To refer a TEI:
1. Open the Tracker Capture app.
2. Open an existing TEI dashboard.
3. In the Timeline Data entry or Tabular data entry widget, click the Arrow icon.
4. Select a Program stage, Organisation unit and set a **Report date**.
5. Click either One-time referral which will only refer TEI for one single event or Move
permanently which will move TEI ownership to the selected Organisation Unit. Further
access to the TEI will be based on the ownership organisation unit.
Mandatory data elements in events
Some data elements in an event might be mandatory (marked with a red star next to the data element
label). What this means is that all mandatory data elements must be filled in before the user is allowed
to complete the event. The exception to this is if the user has the authority called "Ignore validation
of required fields in Tracker and Event Capture". If the user has this authority, the mandatory data
elements will not be required to be filled in before saving and the red star will not be displayed next to
the data element label. Note that super user that have the "ALL" authority automatically have this
authority.
How to use geometry
Tracked entity type, program and program stage can be configured to use a feature type. This makes
it possible to capture geometry for a TEI, program or event. Supported feature types are Point and
Polygon.

program.
117
Using the Tracker Capture app TEI ownership
Enrollments widget
TEI ownership
The current ownership of all enrollments in the selected program is displayed in the "Owned by" part
of the enrollment widget. The ownership will always start out as the organisation unit that first enrolled
the TEI into the given program.
Ownership can be different for a TEIS different programs, for example one clinic can follow up a
patient in HIV, while another clinic follows up the same patient in MCH.
To update the ownership for a TEI/program combination, the user has to utilize the referral
functionality and select the "Move permanently" option while referring.
A user that has capture access to the organisation unit that is the current owner of the TEI/Program
will have write access to all enrollments for that TEI/Program combination. A user that has search
access to the organisation unit that is the current owner will have access to search and find the TEI/
Program combination.

Data approval overview Approving and accepting
Data approval overview
DHIS2 has an optional feature that allows authorized users to approve data that has been entered. It
allows data to be reviewed and approved at selected levels in the organisation unit hierarchy, so the
approval follows the structure of the hierarchy from lower levels to higher levels.
Data is approved for a combination of (a) period, (b) organisation unit and (c) workflow. Data may be
approved for the organisation unit for which it is entered, as well as for higher-level organisation units
to which the data is aggregated. As part of system settings, you can choose the organisation unit
level(s) at which data is approved. It can be approved at higher levels only after it has been approved
for all that organisation unit's descendants at lower levels for the same workflow and period. When you
approve a workflow, it approves data for any data sets that have been assigned to that workflow.
After a period, organisation unit and workflow combination has been approved, data sets associated
with that workflow will be locked for that period and organisation unit, and any further data entry or
modification will be prohibited unless it is first un-approved.
For example, the following diagram illustrates that data has already been approved for organisation
units C and D, for a given period and workflow. It may now be approved for organisation unit B for the
same period and workflow. But it is not ready to be approved for organization unit A. Before it can be
approved for organisation unit A, it must be approved for B, and for any other children of organisation
unit A, for that period and workflow.
Approving at organisation units
Approving and accepting
DHIS2 supports two different types of approval processes: either a one-step process where the data is
approved at each level, or a two-step process where data is first approved and then accepted at each
level. This is illustrated in the following diagram:
Approving and accepting
In the one-step process, data is approved at one level, and then approved at the next higher level.
Until it is approved at the next higher level, it may be unapproved at the first level. (For example, if the
126
Data approval overview Authorities for approving data
data was approved my mistake, this allows the approver to undo their mistake.) Once the data is
approved at the next higher level, it may not be unapproved at the lower level unless it is first
unapproved at the higher level.
In the two-step process, data is approved at one level, and then the approval is accepted at the same
level. This acceptance is done by a user who is authorized to approve data at the next higher level.
Once the data is accepted, it may not be changed or unapproved unless it is first unaccepted.
The two-step process is not required by DHIS2. It is an optional step for a user reviewing data at the
next higher level. It has the benefit of locking the acceptance from the level below, so reviewer does
not have to worry that the data could be changing from below while it is being reviewed. It can also be
used by the higher-level user to keep track of which lower-level data has already been reviewed.
Two-step process can be activated by checking Acceptance required before approval in
SystemSettings app under General section.
Authorities for approving data
To approve data, you must be assigned a role containing one of these authorities:
• Approve data - You may approve data for the organisation unit(s) to which you are assigned.
Note that this authority does not allow you to approve data for lower-levels below the
organisation unit(s) to which you are assigned. This is useful to separate the users authorized
to approve at one level from the users authorized to approve at levels below.
• Approve data at lower levels - Allows you to approve data for all lower levels below the
organisation units assigned to you. This is useful if, for example, you are a district-level user
whose role includes approving the data for all the facilities within that district, but not for the
district itself. If you are assigned this as well as the Approve data authority, you may approve
data at the level of the organisation unit(s) to which you have been assigned, and for any level
below.
• Accept data at lower levels - Allows you to accept data for the level just below the
organisation unit(s) assigned to you. This authority can be given to the same users as approve
data. Or it may be given to different users, if you want to have some users who accept data
from the level below, and a different set of users who approve data to go up to the next level
above.
Configuring data approval
In the Maintenance app section under Data approval level you can specify the levels at which you
want to approve data in the system. Click the Add new button on this page and select the organisation
unit level at which you want approvals. It will be added to the list of approval settings. You may
configure the system for approving data at every organisation unit level, or only at selected
organisation unit levels.
Note that when you add a new approval level, you may optionally choose a Category option group set.
This feature is discussed later in this chapter.
Also in maintenance under Data approval workflow, you can define the workflows that will be used for
approving data. Each workflow can be associated with one or more approval levels. Any two
workflows may operate at all the same approval levels as each other, some of the same and some
different levels, or completely different levels.
127
Data approval overview Data visibility
If you want data for a data set to be approved according to a workflow, then assign the workflow to the
data set when you add or edit the data set. If you do not want data for a data set to be subject to
approval, then do not assign any workflow to that data set. For data sets that you want to approve at
the same time as each other, assign them to the same workflow. For data sets that you want to
approve independently, assign each data set to its own workflow.
Under System Settings -> Analytics, you can control what unapproved data (if any) will appear in
analytics. See the "Analytics settings" section of this user guide. Note that users who are assigned to
organisation units where data is ready for approval can alwyas view this data in analytics, as can
users assigned to higher-level organisation units if they have the Approve data at lower levels
authority or the View unapproved data authority.
Data visibility
If the option Hide unapproved data in analytics is enabled, data will be hidden from viewing by users
associated with higher levels. When determining whether a data record should be hidden for a specific
user, the system associates a user with a specific approval level and compares it to the level to which
the data record has been approved up to. A user is associated with the approval level which matches
the level of the organisation unit(s) she is linked to, or if no approvel level exists at that level, the next
approval level linked to an organisation unit level below herself. A user will be allowed to see data
which has been approved up to the level immediately below her associated approval level. The
rationale behind this is that a user must be ablet to view the data that has been approved below so
that she can eventually view and approve it herself.
Note that if the user has been granted the View unapproved data or the ALL authority she will be able
to view data irrespective of the approval status.
Lets consider the following example: There are four organisation unit levels, with approval levels
associated with level 2 and 4. User A at country level (1) gets associated with approval level 1 since
the approval level exists at the same level as the organisation unit level. User B gets associated with
approval level 2 since there is no approval level directly linked to her organisation unit level and
approval level 2 is the immediate level below. User C gets associated with approval level 2. User D is
below all approval levels which implies that she can see all data entered at or below her organisation
unit level.
Hiding of unapproved data
Using this example, lets consider some scenarios:
• Data is entered at facility level: Only User D can see the data, as the data has not yet been
approved at all.
128
Data approval overview Approving data
Data is approved by User D at facility level: Data becomes visible to User C and User B, as the
• 
data is now approved at their level.
• Data is approved by User C at district level: Data becomes visible to User A, as data is now
approved at the level immediately below herself.
Approving data
To approve data, go to Reports and choose Data Approval. When this report shows data that is
configured for approval, it shows the approval status of the data in the report. The approval status will
be one of the following:
• Waiting for lower level org units to approve - This data is not yet ready to be approved,
because it first needs to be approved for all the child organisation units to this organisation unit,
for the same workflow and period.
• Ready for approval - This data may now be approved by an authorized user.
• Approved - This data has already been approved.
• Approved and accepted - This data has already been approved, and also accepted.
If the data you are viewing is in an approval state that can be acted upon, and if you have sufficient
authority, one or more of the following actions will be available to you on the Data Approval form:
• Approve - Approve data that has not yet been approved, or that was formerly approved and
has been unapproved.
• Unapprove - Return to an unapproved state data that has been approved or accepted.
• Accept - Accept data that has been approved.
• Unaccept - Return to an unaccepted (but still approved) state data that has been accepted.
In order to unapprove data for a given organisation unit, you must have the authority to approve data
for that organisation unit or to approve data for a higher-level organisation unit to which that data is
aggregated. The reason for this is as follows: If you are reviewing data for approval at a higher
organisation unit level, you should consider whether the data at lower organisation units are
reasonable. If all lower-level data looks good, you can approve the data at the higher level. If some
lower-level data looks suspect, you can unapprove the data at the lower level. This allows the data to
be reviewed again at the lower level, corrected if necessary, and re-approved up through the
organisation unit levels according to the hierarchy.
Approving by category option group set
When defining an approval level, you specify the organisation unit level at which data will be
approved. You may also optionally specify a category option group set. This is useful if you are using
category option groups to define additional dimensions of your data, and you want approvals to be
based on these dimensions. The following examples illustrate how this can be done within a single
category option group set, and by using multiple category option group sets.
129
Data approval overview Approving by one category option group set
Approving by one category option group set
For example, suppose you define a category option group set to represent NGOs who serve as
healthcare partners at one or more organisation units. Each category option group within this set
represents a different partner. The category option group for Partner 1 may group together category
options (such as funding account codes) that are used by that partner as a dimension of the data. So
data entered by Partner 1 is attributed to a category option in Partner 1's category option group.
Whereas data entered by partner 2 is attributed to a category option in Partner 2's category option
group:
Example Category Option Groups
Category option group set Category option group Category options
Partner Partner 1 Account 1A, Account 1B
Partner Partner 2 Account 2A, Account 2B
Each partner could enter data for their accounts independently of the other, for the same or different
workflows, at the same or different facilities. So for example, data can be entered and/or aggregated
at the following levels for each partner, independently of each other:
Example category option groups
Tip
You can use the sharing feature on category options and category option
groups to insure that a user can enter data (and/or see data) only for
certain category options and groups. If you don't want users to see data
that is aggregated beyond of their assigned category options and/or
category option groups, you can assign Selected dimension restrictions for
data analysis, when adding or updating a user.
You can optionally define approval levels for partner data within any or all of these organisation unit
levels. For example, you could define any or all of the following approval levels:
Example Category Option Group Set approval levels
Approval level Organisation unit level Category option group set
1 Country Partner
2 District Partner
130
Data approval overview Approving by multiple category option group sets
Approval level Organisation unit level Category option group set
3 Facility Partner
Approving by multiple category option group sets
You can also define approval levels for different category option group sets. To continue the example,
suppose that you have various agencies that manage the funding to the different partners. For
example, Agency A funds accounts 1A and 2A, while Agency B funds accounts 1B and 2B. You could
set up category option groups for Agency A, and Agency B, and make them both part of a category
option group set called Agency. So you would have:
Example Multiple Category Option Group Sets
Category option group set Category option group Category options
Partner Partner 1 Account 1A, Account 1B
Partner Partner 2 Account 2A, Account 2B
Agency Agency A Account 1A, Account 2A
Agency Agency B Account 1B, Account 2B
Now suppose that at the country level, you want each partner to approve the data entered by that
partner. Once this approval is done, you want each agency to then approve the data from accounts
that are managed by that agency. Finally, you want to approve data at the country level across all
agencies. You could do this by defining the following approval levels:
Example Multiple Category Option Group Set approval levels
Approval level Organisation unit level Category option group set
1 Country
2 Country Agency
3 Country Partner
Note that multiple approval levels can be defined for the same organisation unit level. In our example,
Partner 1 would approve country-wide data at approval level 3 from category options Account 1A and
Account 1B. Next, Agency A would approve country-wide data at approval level 2 from category
options Account 1A (after approval by Partner 1) and Account 2A (after approval by Partner 2.) Finally,
after approval from all agencies, country-wide data can be approved at approval level 1 across all
category options. Note that approval level 1 does not specify a category option group set, meaning
that it is for approving data across all category options.
This example is meant to be illustrative only. You may define as many category option groups as you
need, and as many approval levels as you need at the same organisation unit level for different
category option group sets.
If you have multiple approval levels for different category option group sets at the same organisation
unit level, you may change the approval ordering in the Settings section, under System Approval
Settings. Just click on the approval level you wish to move, and select Move up or Move down. If you
have an approval level with no category option groups set, it must be the highest approval level for
that organisation unit level.

Review dataset reports
Once a workflow, period, and organisation unit have been selected, you can review the dataset reports
for the datasets connected to the selected workflow. The data for each dataset is presented in a tab.
Datasets can have different period types than the workflow the are connected to. If this is the case, the
approval app will show data for all the dataset-periods that end within the selected workflow period.
Review dataset reports
Take an approval action
Once you have reviewed the data in the datasets, you can proceed to take an approval action. The
following actions are available:
• Approve
• Accept
• Unapprove
• Unaccept
Which of these actions are available for a given workflow at a given moment in time depends on the
type of actions which have been taken already at the current and other levels of the organisational
hierarchy.
In the example above the "approve" action is available. When you choose the "Approve" action, you
are presented with a confirmation dialog as displayed below which summarises the datasets you are
approving. The workflow is not approved until you click "Approve" to confirm there. Other actions take
effect immediately and do not have a confirmation step.
134
Data approval Approval status tags
Take an approval action
After taking one of the approval actions, in this case after confirming the approval, the workflow is
updated immediately and you see a the new approval status.
Updated approval status
Approval status tags
As shown in the image above, the approval status is displayed in two places:
1. Above the dataset tabs, after the workflow information
2. Before the buttons on the bottom bar
135
Data approval Approval status tags
These status tags may not always display the same information, because the have a slightly different
meaning:
1. The status tag above the dataset represents the approval status of the workflow for the selected
period and selected organisation unit
2. The status tag in the bottom bar does the same, but also takes your user profile.
A workflow may be ready to be approved at a given organisation unit level, but you do not have the
appropriate authority to do so.
136
Reporting functionality in the reports app Using standard reports
Reporting functionality in the reports app
The reports app allows for canned, standard reports, data set reports, resources and org unit
distribution reports.
Using standard reports
You access the available reports by navigating to Apps->Reports. In the report menu in the left bar,
click Standard Report. A list of all pre-defined reports will appear in the main window.
You run/view a report by clicking on the triple-dot icon of the report and then selecting "Create" from
the contextual menu. If there are any pre-defined parameters, you will see a report parameter window
where you must fill in the values needed for orgunit and/or reporting month, depending on what has
been defined in the underlying report table(s). Click on "Generate Report" when you are ready. The
report will either appear directly in your browser or be available as a PDF file for download, depending
on your browser settings for handling PDF files. You can save the file and keep it locally on your
computer for later use.
Using dataset reports
Dataset reports are printer friendly views of the data entry screen filled with either raw or aggregated
data. These are only available for data sets that have custom data entry forms and not for default or
section forms.
You can access data set reports from Apps->Reports.
A Criteria window will appear where you fill in the details for your report:
Dataset: The data set you want to display.
Report period: The actual period you want data for. This can be aggregated as well as raw periods.
This means that you can ask for a quarterly or annual report even though the data set is collected
monthly. A data set's period type (collection frequency) is defined in data set maintenance. First select
the period type (Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly etc.) in the drop down next to Prev and Next buttons, and
then select one of the available periods from the dropdown list below. Use Prev and Next to jump one
year back or forward.
137
Reporting functionality in the reports app Using reporting rate summary
Use data for selected unit only: Use this option if you want a report for an orgunit that has children,
but only want the data collected directly for this unit and not the data collected by its children. If you
want a typical aggregated report for an orgunit you do not want to tick this option.
Report Organisation unit: Here you select the orgunit you want the report for. This can be at any
level in the hierarchy as the data will be aggregated up to this level automatically (if you do not tick the
option above).
When you are done filling in the report criteria you click on "Generate". The report will appear as
HTML in a printer-friendly format. Use the print and save as functions in the browser to print or save
(as HTML) the report.You can also export the data set report in Excel and PDF formats.
Using reporting rate summary
Access the reporting rate summary from the Apps->Reports menu. Reporting rate summaries will
show how many datasets (forms) that have been submitted by organisation unit and period.
The reporting rate is calculation is based on complete data set registrations. A complete data set
registration refers to a user marking a data entry form as complete, typically by clicking the complete
button in the data entry screen, hereby indicating to the system that she considers the form to be
complete. This is i.e. a subjective approach to calculating completeness.
The reporting rate summary will for each row show a range of measures:
• Actual reports: Indicates the number of data entry complete registrations for the relevant data
set.
• Expected reports: Indicates how many data entry complete registrations are expected. This
number is based on the number of organisation units the relevant data set has been assigned
to (enabled for data entry).
• Reporting rate: The percentage of reports registered as complete based on the number
expected.
• Reports on time: Same as actual reports, only reports registered as complete within the
maximum number of days after the end of the reporting period. This number of days after
reporting period can be defined per data set in the data set management.
• Reporting rate on time: Same as percentage, only reports registered as complete on time used
as numerator.
To run the report you can follow these steps:
• Select an orgunit from the tree.
• Select a data set.
• Select a period type and a period from the list of available periods for that period type.
• The report will then be rendered. Change any of the parameters above and click "Get report"
again see the corresponding results.

Reporting functionality in the reports app Using resources
Using resources
The resource tool allows you to upload both files from your local computer to the DHIS server and to
add links to other resources on the Internet through URLs. If cloud storage is configured for your
system, resources will be saved there.
To create a new resource:
1. Open the Reports app and click Resource.
2. Click Add new.
3. Enter a Name.
4. Select a Type: Upload file or External URL.
5. Click Save.
Using organisation unit distribution reports
You can access the Orgunit Distribution reports from the left side menu in the Apps->Reports.
Orgunit distribution reports are reports that show how the orgunits are distributed on various properties
like type and ownership, and by geographical areas.
The result can be presented in a table-based report or in a chart.
Running a report:
To run a report first select an orgunit in the upper left side orgunit tree. The report will be based on
orgunits located under the selected orgunit. The select the orgunit group set that you want to use,
typically these are Type, Ownership, Rural/Urban, but can be any user-defined orgunit group set. The
you can click on either Get Report to get the table-based presentation or Get chart to get the same
result in a chart. You can also download the table-based report as Excel or CSV.

fixed or relative period.
Layout restrictions: exactly 1 item each as vertical
and horizontal, data dimension is locked to vertical
and horizontal, organisation unit is locked to points.
Select dimensions
From the dimensions menu on the left you can select the dimensions you want to show in your
visualization, including data, period, organisation units and dynamic dimensions. These can be added
by clicking on a dimension, by dragging and dropping a dimension to the layout area or by hovering
over a dimension and using on its context menu (three dots).
145
Using the Data Visualizer app Select dimensions
Just like in the dimensions menu, in the layout area you can also change the selections by clicking on
a dimension, dragging and dropping a dimension or by using a dimension's context menu (three dots).
146
Using the Data Visualizer app Select dimension items
• Series: A series is a set of continuous, related elements (for example periods or data elements)
that you want to visualize in order to emphasize trends or relations in its data. Also known as
Columns for Pivot table visualizations.
• Categories: A category is a set of elements (for example indicators or organisation units) for
which you want to compare its data. Also known as Rows for Pivot table visualizations.
• Filter: The filter selection will filter the data displayed in the visualization. Note that if you use
the data dimension as filter, you can only specify a single indicator or data set as filter item,
whereas with other dimension types you can select any number of items.
Select dimension items
A dimension refers to the elements that describe the data values in the system. There are three main
dimensions in the system:
• Data: Includes data elements, indicators and datasets (reporting rates), describing the
phenomena or event of the data.
• Periods: Describes when the event took place.
• Organisation units: Describes where the event took place.
Data Visualizer is highly flexible in terms of allowing you to use these dimensions as series, categories
and filter.
To select items for a dimension, open the dimension modal window by clicking on a dimension. This
window will also be opened automatically when adding a dimension without selected items to the
layout. Select which items to add to the visualization by double-clicking an item or by selecting an item
with a single click and using the arrows in the middle. The order of appearance will be the same as the
order in which they are selected. Selected items can be reordered by dragging and dropping them in
the Selected section.
Select data items
When selecting data items, there are different ways to filter the displayed items. By using the search
field at the top, a global search by item name is performed across the currently selected Data Type.
By selecting a Data Type from the dropdown, items can be filtered by type and subtype, where the
subtype available depends on the selected data type. The name search and the type/subtype filtering
can be combined as well for a more detailed filter. The type of each displayed item is indicated by a
corresponding icon on the item. By hovering over an item, the name of the type can be viewed as well.
147
Using the Data Visualizer app Select dimension items
Select periods
When selecting a Period you have the option to choose between fixed periods and relative periods.
These can also be combined. Overlapping periods are filtered so that they only appear once. For
relative periods the names are relative to the current date, e.g. if the current month is March and Last
month is selected, the month of February is shown in the visualization.
148
Using the Data Visualizer app Select dimension items
Select organisation units
The organisation units dialog is flexible, offering essentially three ways of selecting organisation units:
• Explicit selection: Use the tree to explicitly select the organisation units you want to appear in
the visualization. If you right-click on an organisation unit you can easily choose to select all org
units below it.
• Levels and groups: The Level and Group dropdowns are a convenient way to select all units in
one or more org unit groups or at specific levels. Example: select Chiefdom (level 3) to get all
org units at that level.
Please note that as soon as at least one level or group has been selected the org unit tree now
acts as the boundary for the levels/groups. Example: if you select Chiefdom (level 3) and 
Kailahun org unit (at level 2) in the tree you get all chiefdom units inside Kailahun district.
• The user's organisation units:
◦ User organisation unit: This is a way to dynamically select the org units that the logged in
user is associated to.
◦ User sub-units: Selects the sub-units of the user organisation unit.
◦ User sub-x2-units: Selects the units two levels below the user organisation unit.
149
Using the Data Visualizer app Select dimension items
Select dynamic dimensions
When selecting a dynamic dimension, either individual or all items can be selected. By default, the 
Manually select items option is selected, which allows for individual items to be picked out of a list,
similar to how the Data and Period dimensions are selected above. To automatically select all items
for a dimension, the Automatically include all items option can be selected. This will also include
any additional items that are added in the future if the available dimension items are updated.
150
Using the Data Visualizer app Two category charts
Two category charts
Most chart visualization types can show two categories. Switching from Pivot Table to Column, Bar,
Area (and their stacked versions) and Line is keeping the first two dimensions in Category, any
additional dimension is moved to Filter. The labels for the first dimension in Category are shown at the
top of the chart, and the ones for the second dimension at the bottom. The resulting visualization is
composed of separate charts, one for each item in the first dimension.

Using the Data Visualizer app Custom styling for text and series key in charts
Option Description
Outliers tab
Outlier detection method Outlier analysis is a process that involves identifying
anomalous observations in a dataset. In Data
Visualizer outliers are detected by first normalizing
the data into a linear regression line and then
analysing each point's distance from regression line.
Currently three methods are supported. Interquartile
Range (IQR) is based on dividing a dataset into
quartiles while Modified z-score is based on the
Median Absolute Deviation (MAD). IQR and MAD are
considered the two most common robust measures
of scale. Standard z-score is based on standard
deviation and is therefore considered less robust as
it is greatly influenced by outliers.
Threshold factor The number that the outlier thresholds are multiplied
by. Controls the sensitivity of the threshold range.
Default factors are 1.5 for IQR and 3 for z-scores.
Custom styling for text and series key in charts
The following options can be customized using the text styling tool: Chart title, Chart
subtitle, Show series key, Target line, Base line, Axis title and Labels for both
horizontal and vertical axes. The text styling tool allows to choose a font size, color and italic/bold
variants. It's also possible to choose the position of the text.
Adding Assigned Categories
Assigned Categories is a composite dimension that represents associated category option
combinations to the selected data element's category combination. This can be added by dragging the
Assigned Categories dimension from the left side dimensions menu and into the visualization layout:
157
Using the Data Visualizer app Adding more axes
Another way of adding assigned categories is by accessing the Add Assigned Categories option
from the Data dimension's context menu (not available for Gauge, Year over year or Single
value).
Adding more axes
When combining data with different measurement scales you will get a more meaningful visualization
by having more than a single axis. For Column, Bar, Area and Line you can do so by clicking the 
Series tab in the Options dialog. If the option is disabled, make sure that the Data dimension is on
the Series axis and that at least two items have been added.
Four axes are available, two on the left side (axis 1 and 3) of the chart and two on the right side (axis 2
and 4). Each axis has a different color and the chart items are going to be colored accordingly.
Note
When multiple axes are in use, the Color set option in the Style tab will
be disabled. The Target line and Base line options are available on
the Axes tab per axis.
Using multiple visualization types
It's possible to combine a Column chart with Line items and vice versa. This is done by clicking the 
Series tab in the Options dialog and changing the Visualization type. This can also be
combined with using multiple axes (as described in the section above).
158
Using the Data Visualizer app Data drilling
This results in a chart that combines the Column and Line types.
Data drilling
This feature is enabled for the Pivot Table, Column, Stacked column, Bar and Bar stacked
visualization types and allows to drill in the data by clicking on a value cell / column / bar in the
visualization. A contextual menu opens with various options.
You can drill the data by organisation unit, meaning navigating up and down the org unit tree. The data
drill affects the current dimension selection in the layout area. The organisation unit dimension must
thus be present on either the Columns / Series axis or the Rows / Category axis for the drill feature to
be enabled.

Analyze data in pivot tables About the Pivot Table app
Analyze data in pivot tables
About the Pivot Table app
With the Pivot Table app, you can create pivot tables based on all available data dimensions in
DHIS2. A pivot table is a dynamic tool for data analysis which lets you summarize and arrange data
according to its dimensions. Examples of data dimensions in DHIS2 are:
• data dimension itself (for example data elements, indicators and events)
• periods (representing the time period for the data)
• organisation hierarchy (representing the geographical location of the data)
From these dimensions you can freely select dimension items to include in the pivot table. You can
create additional dimensions in DHIS2 with the group set functionality. This allows for different
aggregation pathways, such as aggregation by "Partner" or facility type.
A pivot table can arrange data dimensions on columns, rows, and as filters. When you place a data
dimension on columns, the pivot table will display one column per dimension item. If you place
multiple data dimensions on columns, the pivot table displays one column for all combinations of the
items in the selected dimensions. When you place a data dimension on rows, the pivot table displays
one row per dimension item in a similar fashion. The dimensions you select as filters will not be
included in the pivot table, but will aggregate and filter the table data based on the selected filter items.
Tip
• You must select at least one dimension on columns or rows.
• You must include at least one period.
• Data element group sets and reporting rates can't appear in the
same pivot table.
• A pivot table can't contain more than the maximum number of
analytic records which have been specified in the system settings.
The maximum number of records could also be constrained by the
maximum RAM which is available to your browser. You will be
prompted with a warning if your requested table exceeds a particular
size. From this prompt, you can either cancel the request or continue
building the table. Consider making smaller tables instead of one
table which displays all of your data elements and indicators
together.
• The Pivot Table app supports drill-down and up for periods and
organisation unit. This means that you can for example drill down
from yearly periods to quarters, months and weeks inside a pivot
table. You can also drill down from the global organisation unit to
countries, provinces and facilities.
Create a pivot table
1. Open the Pivot Table app.
2. In the menu to the left, select the dimension items you want to analyse, for example data
elements or indicators.
3. Click Layout and arrange the data dimensions as columns, rows and filters.
167
Analyze data in pivot tables Select dimension items
You can keep the default selection if you want.
4. Click Update.
In this example, indicators are listed as columns and periods as rows.
Select dimension items
The left menu lists sections for all available data dimensions. From each section you can select any
number of dimension items. As an example, you can open the section for data elements and select
any number of data elements from the available list. You can select an item by marking it and clicking
on the arrow in the section header or simply double-clicking on the item. Before you can use a data
dimension in your pivot table you must at least select one dimension item. If you arrange a dimension
as columns or rows but do not select any dimension items, the dimension is ignored.
You must choose at least one data dimension type to create a pivot table. The available types are
described in this table:
Data dimension types

_ Reporting rates on time: the
reporting rates based on timely

representing events.
You can combine these dimensions to display for example aggregate data with reporting rates, or
event data items together with program indicators, all in the same pivot tables. For the "data element"
data dimension, you are also able to select "Totals" and "Details", which will allow you to view different
category combination options together on the same pivot table.
For the period dimension you can choose between using fixed periods or relative periods. An example
of a fixed period is "January 2012". To select fixed periods start by selecting a period type from the
period type list. You can then select periods from the list of available periods.
Relative periods are periods relative to the current date. Examples of relative periods are "Last
month", "Last 12 months", "Last 5 years". Relative periods can be selected by ticking the check-boxes
next to each period. The main advantage of using relative periods is that when you save a pivot table
favorite, it will stay updated with the latest data as time goes by without the need for constantly
updating it.
For the organisation unit dimension you can select any number of organisation units from the
hierarchy. To select all organisation units below a specific parent organisation unit, right click and click
"Select all children". To manually select multiple organisation units, click and hold the Ctrl key while
clicking on organisation units. You can tick "User org unit", "User sub-units" or "User sub-x2-units" in

Analyze data in pivot tables Modify pivot table layout
order to dynamically insert the organisation unit or units associated with your user account. This is
useful when you save a pivot table favorite and want to share it with other users, as the organisation
units linked with the other user's account will be used when viewing the favorite.
Dynamic dimensions can consist of organisation unit group sets, data element group sets, or category
option group sets which have been configured with the type of "Disaggregation". Once the group sets
have been configured, they will be come available in the pivot tables, and can be used as additional
analysis dimensions, for instance to analyse aggregate data by Type of organisation unit or
Implementing partner. Dynamic dimensions work the same as fixed dimensions.
Tip
Some dynamic dimensions may contain many items. This can cause issues
with certain browsers due to the length of the URL when many dimension
members are selected. A special "All" check box is available for dynamic
dimensions, which allows you to include all available dimensions implicitly
in your pivot table, without specifying each and every dimension member.
Modify pivot table layout
After selecting data dimensions it is time to arrange your pivot table. Click "Layout" in the top menu to
open the layout screen. In this screen you can position your data dimensions as table columns, rows
or filters by clicking and dragging the dimensions from the dimensions list to the respective column,
row and filter lists. You can set any number of dimensions in any of the lists. For instance, you can
click on "Organisation units" and drag it to the row list in order to position the organisation unit

dimension as table rows. Note that indicators, data elements and data set reporting rates are part of
the common "Data" dimension and will be displayed together in the pivot table. For instance, after
selecting indicators and data elements in the left menu, you can drag "Organisation Unit" from the
available dimensions list to the row dimension list in order to arrange them as rows in the pivot table.
After you have set up your pivot table you can click "Update" to render your pivot table, or click "Hide"
to hide the layout screen without any changes taking effect. Since we in our example have selected
both the period and organisation unit dimension as rows, the pivot table will generate all combinations
of the items in these dimensions and produce a table like this:

Option Description
Hide empty columns Hides empty columns from the
table. This is useful when you
look at large tables where a big
part of the dimension items
don't have data in order to
keep the table more readable.
Skip rounding Skips the rounding of data
values, offering the full
precision of data values. Can
be useful for finance data
where the full dollar amount is
required.
Aggregation type The default aggregation
operator can be over-ridden
here, by selecting a different
aggregation operator. Some of
the aggregation types are Cou
nt, Min and Max.
Number type Sets the type of value you want
to display in the pivot table: Va
lue, Percentage of row or Pe
rcentage of column.
The options Percentage of
row and**Percentage of
column** mean that you'll
display values as percentages
of row total or percentage of
column total instead of the
aggregated value. This is
useful when you want to see
the contribution of data
elements, categories or
organisation units to the total
value.
Measure criteria Allows for the data to be
filtered on the server side.
You can instruct the system to
return only records where the
aggregated data value is
equal, greater than, greater or
equal, less than or less or
equal to certain values.
If both parts of the filter are
used, it's possible to filter out a
range of data records.

About the Maps app
The Maps App is introduced in release 2.29 and serves as a replacement of the GIS App offering a
more intuitive and user-friendly interface. The mapping engine from version 2.34 is based on WebGL
technology, capable of showing thousands of features on a map simultaneously.
With the Maps app you can overlay multiple layers and choose among different base maps. You can
create thematic maps of areas and points, view facilities based on classifications, and visualize
catchment areas for each facility. You can add labels to areas and points, and search and filter using
various criteria. You can move points and set locations on the fly. Maps can be saved as favorites and
shared with other users and groups, or downloaded as an image.
Note
To use predefined legends in the Maps app, you need to create them first in
the Maintenance app.

About the Dashboards app
The Dashboards app makes it possible to present a high level overview of your data, including
displaying analytical objects such as maps, charts, reports and tables, as well as displaying text-based
information, resource links, and app widgets.
Features of the Dashboards app include:
• View and print dashboards
• Create and edit dashboards
• Share dashboards with users and user groups
• Apply temporary filters while viewing dashboards
• Responsive view on mobile devices and small screens
• Access dashboards while offline
Dashboards app layout
Dashboards have a title, description, and any number of dashboard items. Above the dashboard is the
dashboards bar, which shows all your available dashboards, a dashboard search field, and a + button
for creating a new dashboard.
The Dashboards app has two modes: view and edit/create. When you first log in to DHIS2, your most
recently used dashboard will be displayed in view mode, if you are on the same computer as you were
previously. If you are using a different computer or browser, then the first starred dashboard will be
displayed. If there are no starred dashboards, then the first dashboard (alphabetically) will be
displayed. Starred dashboards always show first in the dashboard list.
Below is an example of a dashboard named "Antenatal Care", which has been populated with charts
and maps:
Personalization
The Dashboards app can be personalized in the following ways:
• Set the height of the dashboards bar
232
Managing dashboards Responsive view on small screens
• Star dashboards for quick access to your favorite dashboards
• Show or hide dashboard description
Responsive view on small screens
When viewing dashboards on small screens (for instance, portrait orientation on a mobile phone ), the
dashboard will adapt to the screen and show all items in a single column. Some options, including
editing, filtering and sharing, will not be available.
Searching for a dashboard
You can search for a specific dashboard using the search field in the upper left of the dashboards bar
entitled “Search for a dashboard”. The search is case insensitive, and as you type, the list of
dashboards will be narrowed down to those that match your search text.
233

Using the Event Reports app
About the Event Reports app
With the Event Reports app you can analyse events in two types of reports:
• Aggregated event reports: Pivot table-style analysis with aggregated numbers of events
By selecting Aggregated values from the top-left menu you can use the Event Reports app to
create pivot tables with aggregated numbers of events. An event report is always based on a
program. You can do analysis based on a range of dimensions. Each dimension can have a
corresponding filter. Dimensions can be selected from the left-side menu. Similar to the pivot
tables app, aggregated event reports may be limited by the amount of RAM accessible by the
browser. If your requested table exceeds a set size, you will recieve a warning prompt asking
whether or not you want to continue.
• Individual event reports: Lists of events
By selecting Events from the top-left menu you can use the Event Reports app to make
searches or queries for events based on a flexible set of criteria. The report will be displayed as
a table with one row per event. Each dimension can be used as a column in the table or as a
filter. Each dimension can have a criteria (filter). Data elements of type option set allows for "in"
criteria, where multiple options can be selected. Numeric values can be compared to filter
values using greater than, equal or less than operators.

Messaging About messages and feedback messages
Messaging
About messages and feedback messages
Within DHIS2 you can send messages and feedback messages to users, user groups and
organisation units. When you send a feedback message, it is routed to a particular user group called
the feedback recipient group. If you are a member of this user group, you have access to feedback
handling tools. You can, for example, set the status of an incoming feedback to "Pending" while you
are waiting for information.
In addition to the user-to-user and feedback messages, depending on your configuration the system
will also send you system-generated messages. These messages could be triggered by different
events, including system or background job failures and validation analysis results. Feedback handling
tools are also available for validation results and the priority will be set to the importance of the
validation rule violated.
To visit the app click message icon in header bar or find the Messaging app in the app search box.
Note
Messages and feedback messages are not sent to users' e-mail addresses,
the messages only appear within DHIS2.
With 2.30 we introduced a new messaging app which offers a richer
messaging experience. Specifically:
• Switch between list view and compact view by clicking the icon in the
top right corner.
◦ The list view is simplistic and gives a good overview of all
messages and is especially suited for feedback and validation
messages.
◦ The compact view is a modern way of view messages where
the user has more information in one view, hence viewing and
replying several messages is easier.
The first screenshot in this section displays list view, while the
screenshot in section Read a message displays the compact view.
269
Messaging Create a message
A new search field is added which enables the user to search for
• 
messages. The search filters messages on different message
attributes; subject, text and senders. This implies that you are able to
narrow down the message conversation list by entering a search.
• A auto refresh feature is added so that the app fetches new
messages at a set interval, every 5 minutes. This feature is disabled
by default.
• For every message conversation you are able to add participants to
the conversation. This is very useful if you want input on that
particular conversation or if someone should also see the
information. It is not possible to delete participants from a
conversation.
Create a message
1. Click Compose.
2. Define who you want to receive the message. You can send a message to organisation units,
users and user groups.
◦ In the To field you can search for organisation units, users and user groups and select
the wished recipients.
3. Type a subject and a message.
4. Click Send.
270
Messaging Read a message
Read a message
1. Select the appropriate message type to the left.
2. Click a message.
If the message is part of a conversation, you will see all messages in this conversation.
Create a feedback message
1. Follow the steps as for creating a message, only selecting Feedback message instead of
entering recipients.
2. The message will be created as a feedback message and will appear in all of the specified
users' Ticket folder.
Attachments
With 2.31 we introduced attachments to messages. When creating or replying to a message
conversation you have the possibility to add attachments. Currently there are no limitations to type or
size of the file.
Manage validation and feedback messages
Note
You will only see feedback messages and have access to the extended
handling tools if you are a member of the user group that is set up to handle
feedback messages.
With the new app you manage extended tools for tickets and validation

Function Description
Priority You can mark a feedback/validation message with
different priorities: None, Low, Medium or High.
Setting the priority makes it easier to keep track of
which feedback message you need resolved first,
and which feedback messages that can wait.
Status All feedback/validation messages get the status Op
en when created.
To keep track of existing feedback messages, you
can change the status to Pending, Invalid or Solve
d.
You can filter feedback/validation messages based
on their status with the two drop down menus in the
internal header bar.
Assigned to You can assign a feedback message to any member
of the user group that is set up to handle feedback
messages.
You can assign a validation message to any user in
the system.
- means that you haven't assigned a user to the
feedback message.
Internal reply When you work in a feedback handling team you
might want to discuss the feedback before sending
an answer to the sender. You can keep this
discussion in the same message conversation as the
feedback itself.
To send a reply that within the feedback handling
user group, click INTERNAL REPLY.
Configure feedback message function
To configure the feedback message function, you must:
1. Create a user group (for example "Feedback message recipients") that contains all the users
who should receive feedback messages.
2. Open the System Settings app and click General > Feedback recipients and select the user
group you created in the previous step.
273
Set user account preferences Configure feedback message function
Set user account preferences
In Edit user profile, you can add personal information to your profile such as your email address,
mobile phone number, date of birth, profile picture and more. When you send messages, the person
receiving the message can see these profile details. You can also provide account names for various
direct messaging services, which will be used by the system.
In Edit user settings, you can change the display language of DHIS2 and the language of the
database. The database language is the translated content of the metadata, such as data elements
and indicators. You can also choose a display style, and enable or disable SMS and email
notifications. If you wish to, you can choose to display a short name, such as "Joe" in the analysis
modules, rather than your full name.
In Edit account settings, you can reset your password and setup 2-Factor authentication. Setting up
2-Factor authentication will require you to download the Google Authenticator app on you mobile
device.
In the View full profile section, you find a summary of your profile details. This section includes a few
fields that you cannot edit yourself, such as user roles and user organisation units.
In Manage personal access tokens you can view the existing personal access tokens, revoke
existing tokens and generate new ones. Personal access tokens are an alternative to using passwords
for authentication and useful for providing (restricted) access to scripts and external applications. Note
that the values of newly generated personal access tokens are only visible right after generating.
In the About DHIS2 section, you find a list of details about the DHIS2 instance.

Manage categories
About categories
Categories are typically a concept, for example "Gender", "Age" or "Disease Status". Data elements
such as "Number of cases of confirmed malaria" are often broken into smaller component parts to
determine, for example, the number of confirmed malaria cases of particular age groups.
Use categories to disaggregate data elements into individual components. You can also use
categories to assign metadata attributes to all data recorded in a specific dataset, such as
"Implementing partner" or "Funding agency."
Create three categories: "Under 1", "1-5" and "Over 5". Assign them as categories to the data element.
This creates three separate fields for this data in the data entry forms:
• Number of confirmed malaria cases (Under 1)
• Number of confirmed malaria cases (1-5)
• Number of confirmed malaria cases (Over 5)
Without categories, you would have had to create each of the data elements listed above separately.
In the Maintenance app, you manage the following and category objects:

Category combinations lets you combine multiple categories into a related set.
You can disaggregate the data element "Number of new HIV infections" into the following categories:
• HIV Service: "Other", "PMTCT", "TB"
• Gender: "Male", "Female"
In this example, there are two levels of disaggregation that consist of two separate data element
categories. Each data element category consist of several data element category options.
In DHIS2, different data elements are disaggregated according to a common set of categories. By
combining these different categories into a category combination and assigning these combinations to
data elements, you can apply the appropriate disaggregation levels quickly to a large number of data
elements.

Create or edit a category option group
You can group and classify category options by using category option groups. The main purpose of
the category option group set is to add more dimensionality to your captured data for analysis in for
example the Pivot table or Data Visualizer apps.
Consider a system where data is collected by "projects", and projects are modelled as category
options. The system must be able to analyse data based on which donor supports the project. In this
case, create a category option group set called "Donor". Each donor can be created as a category
option group, where each category option / project is put in the appropriate group. In the data analysis
applications, the "Donor" group set will appear as a data dimension, while each donor appear as
dimension items, ready to be included in reports.
To create a category option group:
1. Open the Maintenance app and click Category > Category option group.

Use category combinations for data sets
When categories and category combinations have the data dimension type "Attribute", they can apply
a common set of attributes to a related set of data values contained in a data set. When category
combinations are used as a attribute, they serve as another dimension (similar to "Period" and
"Organisation unit") which you can use in your analysis.
Suppose that a NGO is providing ART services in a given facility. They would need to report each
month on the "ART monthly summary", which would contain a number of data elements. The NGO
and project could potentially change over time. In order to attribute data to a given NGO and project at
any point in time, you need to record this information with each data value at the time of data entry.
1. Create two categories with the data dimension type "Attribute": "Implementing partner" and
"Projects".
2. Create a category combination with the data dimension type "Attribute": "Implementing partners
and projects".
3. Assign the categories you've created to the category combination.
4. Create a data set called "ART monthly summary" and select the "Implementing partners and
projects" category combination.
When you enter data in the Data entry app, you can select an "Implementing partner" and a "Project".
Each recorded data value, is assigned a specific combination of these categories as an attribute.
These attributes (when specified as a dimension) can be used in the analysis applications similar to
other dimensions, for example the period and organisation unit.

About data elements
Data elements are the base of DHIS2. Data elements define what is actually recorded in the system,
for example number of immunisations or number of cases of malaria.
Data elements such as "Number of cases of confirmed malaria" are often broken into smaller
component parts to determine, for example, the number of confirmed malaria cases of particular age
groups.

Manage data sets and data entry forms
About data sets and data entry forms
All data entry in DHIS2 is organised in data sets. A data set is a collection of data elements grouped
together for data entry and data export between instances of DHIS2. To use a data set to collect data
290
Configure metadata About data sets and data entry forms
for a specific organisation unit, you must assign the organisation unit to the data set. Once you have
assigned the data set to an organisation unit, that data set is available in the Data entry app. Only the
organisation units that you have assigned the data set to can use the data set for data entry.
A category combination can link to both data elements and data sets. If you use a category
combination for a data set, the category combinations is applicable for the whole form. This means
that you can use categories to capture information which is common to an entire form, for example the
name of the a project or grant. When a data set is linked to a category combination, those categories
will be displayed as drop-down boxes in the Data entry app. Data captured in the form will then be
linked to the selected category options from those drop-down boxes. For information about how to
create categories and category combinations, see section "Manage data elements and categories".
Make sure that you set the type of categories and category combinations to "Attribute".
An scenario for when categories are useful is when you need to capture a data entry form for a
implementing partner organisation and a project. In that case:
1. Create category options and categories for all partner organisations and projects and link them
in a new category combination.
2. Assign the category combination to the data set (form) for which you need to capture this
information.
When opening this data set in data entry module, the partner organisation and project
categories will automatically be rendered as drop-down boxes, allowing you to select a specific
implementing partner organisation and project before continuing to do data entry.
You create and edit data sets in the Maintenance app. Here you define, for example, which data
elements you want to include in the data set and the data collection frequency.
You enter data in the Data entry app. The Data entry app uses data entry forms to display the data
sets. There are three types of data entry forms:
Data entry form types
Data entry form type Description
Default form Once you have assigned a data set to an
organisation unit, a default form is created
automatically. The default form is then available in
the Data entry app for the organisation units you
have assigned it to.
A default form consist of a list of the data elements
belonging to the data set together with a column for
inputting the values. If your data set contains data
elements with a non-default category combination,
for example age groups or gender, additional
columns are automatically created in the default form
based on the different categories.
If you use more than one category combination you
get multiple columns in the default form with different
column headings for the options.
291
Configure metadata About data sets and data entry forms
Data entry form type Description
Section form If the default form doesn't meet your needs, you can
modify it to create a section form. Section forms give
you more flexibility when it comes to using tabular
forms.
In a section form you can, for example, create
multiple tables with subheadings and disable (grey
out) cells in a table.
When you have added a section form to a data set,
the section form is available in the Data entry app.
Custom form If the form you want to design is too complicated for
default or section forms, you can create a custom
form. A custom form takes more time to create than a
section form, but you have full control over the
design.
You can, for example, mimic an existing paper
aggregation form with a custom form. This makes
data entry easier, and should reduce the number
incorrectly entered data elements.
When you have added a custom form to a data set,
the custom form is available in the Data entry app.
Note
If a data set has both a section form and a custom form, the system
displays the custom form during data entry. Users who enter data can't
select which form they want to use. In web-based data entry the order of
display preference is:
1. Custom form (if it exists)
2. Section form (if it exists)
3. Default form
Mobile devices do not support custom forms. In mobile-based data entry
the order of display preference is:
1. Section form (if it exists)
2. Default form
In the Maintenance app, you manage the following data set objects:

293
Configure metadata Create or edit a data set
Click the add button.
2. 
3. In the Name field, type the precise name of the data set.
4. In the Short name field, define a short name for the data set.
Typically, the short name is an abbreviation of the full data set name. This attribute is often used
to display the name of the data set where space is limited.
5. (Optional) In the Code field, assign a code.
6. In the Description field, type a description of the data set.
7. Enter the number of Expiry days.
The number of expiry days controls for how long it should be possible to enter data in the Data
entry app for this data set. Expiry days refer to the number of days after the end date of the
selected data entry period where the data entry form should be open for entry. After the number
of days has expired, the data set will be locked for further entry.
You can set manual exceptions to this using the lock exception functionality in the Data
Administration app.
Note
To allow data entry into all possible historical time periods, set the number of
expiry days to zero.
8. If you want it to be possible to enter data for future periods, type the number of periods in the 
Open future periods for data entry field.
The value is the number of future periods which are available for data entry.
For a monthly data set a value of 2 allows you to enter data for 2 months in advance. This is
useful for, by example, population, target and planning data.
9. In the Days after period to qualify for timely submission field, type the number of days in
which data can be entered to be considered reported on time.
To verify the number of timely reports submitted, go to Reports > Reporting rate summary.
10. Select a Period type.
The period type defines the frequency of reporting for the particular data set. The frequency can
for example be daily, quarterly or yearly.
11. Select a Category combination to assign it to the data set.
Tip
Click Add new to create category combinations that you're missing. In the form
that opens, create the category combinations you need. When you're done, click 
Refresh values.
12. If you selected a category combination other than None, you may enter zero or a positive
number for Open periods after category option end date. This lets you enter data in this data
set for a category option up to the specified number of periods after that category option's end
date.

absence, select Missing values requires comment on complete.
20. (Optional) Assign one or multiple Legends.
21. If applicable, select Skip offline.
This option controls whether this data entry form should be downloaded and saved in the user's
web browser. Normally you shouldn't select Skip offline. This is the default setting. If you have
big forms which are rarely used you can consider selecting this option to speed up initial loading
in the data entry module.
22. If applicable, select Data element decoration
If you select this option, descriptions of data elements render in call-outs in downloaded data
sets in offline mode in the Data entry app.
23. If applicable, select Render sections as tabs.
This option is only applicable for section forms. The option allows you to render each section as
a tab horizontally above the data set. This is useful for long data sets as it allows appropriate
sections to be selected quickly without going through the entire form.
24. If applicable, select Render vertically.
This option is only applicable for section forms.
25. Select data elements and assign them.
You can override the category combination for each selected data set by clicking on the gear

Override data elements' category combinations in a data set
You can override which category combination to use for a data element within the context of a data
set. This means that a data element can use different category combinations within different data sets.
This is useful when you want to reuse a data element since you don't have to replicate the data
element to allow multiple category combinations.
If different regions within your organisation unit hierarchy use different disaggregations, or if the
disaggregations change over time, you can represent this by creating different data sets with the
appropriate category combinations.

dhis2.util.on( 'dhis2.de.event.formReady', function( event, ds ) {
  console.log( 'The form with id: ' + ds + ' is loaded!' );
} );
dhis2.util.on( 'dhis2.de.event.dataValueSaved', function( event, ds, dv ) {
  console.log( 'Data value: ' + dv.value + ' was saved with data element: ' + dv.de );
} );
dhis2.util.on( 'dhis2.de.event.completed', function( event, ds, cr ) {
  console.log( 'Form was completed for org unit: ' + cr.ou );
} );
</script>
Note
Be careful to only use "namespaced" events like the ones in the example
above and not general ones like "click" as the dhis2.util.on method will
deregister the event first.

Configure metadata Change sharing settings for metadata objects
If your function only applies to certain data sets you can use the supplied data set identifier and
shortcut your function for unwanted data sets like this:
dhis2.de.on( 'dhis2.de.event.validationSuccess', function( event, ds ) {
  if ( $.inArray( ds, ['utXOiGbEj14', 'Re7qzHEThSC'] ) == -1 ) {
    return false;
  }
  console.log( 'Form with id: ' + ds + ' validated successfully!' );
} );
The identifiers of the input fields in the data entry form is on the format described below. This format
can be used to select the input fields in your script and perform actions on them:
<dataelementid>-<optioncomboid>-val
Since the data set identifier is provided for all events a feasible alternative is to utilize the "files" Web
API resource and keep your callback functions in a single file, where you let the JavaScript code take
action based on which data set is currently loaded.
Functions
The DHIS2 data entry module contains JavaScript API functions which can be accessed from custom
data entry forms.
dhis2.de.api.getSelections: This function returns a JavaScript object which contains properties for all
dimensions with corresponding values for the identifiers of the selected options. It contains properties
for "ds" (data set), "pe" (period), "ou" (organisation unit) and identifiers for all data set categories.
An example response looks like this:
{
 +  ds: "lyLU2wR22tC",
 +  pe: "201605",
 +  ou: "g8upMTyEZGZ",
 +  LFsZ8v5v7rq: "CW81uF03hvV",
 +  yY2bQYqNt0o: "yMj2MnmNI8L"
 +}
Example JavaScript usage of this function:
var sel = dhis2.de.api.getSelections();
 +var orgUnit = sel["ou"];
 +var partner = sel["LFsZ8v5v7rq"];
Change sharing settings for metadata objects
You can assign different sharing settings to metadata objects, for example organisation units and
tracked entity attributes. These sharing settings control which users and users groups that can view or
edit a metadata object.
Some metadata objects also allows you to change the sharing setting of data entry for the object.
These additional settings control who can view or enter data in form fields using the metadata.

About indicators
An indicator is a formula that can consist of multiple data elements, constants, organisation unit group
counts and mathematical operators. The indicator consist typically of a numerator and denominator.
You use indicators to calculate coverage rates, incidence and other values that are a result of data
element values that have been entered into the system. Calculated totals do not have a denominator.
Note
You never enter indicator values directly in DHIS2, you calculate them.
An indicator formula can consist of mathematical operators, for example plus and minus; functions
(see below); and of the following elements:
Indicator elements
Indicator element Type Description
Constant Component Constants are numerical values
which remain the same for all
indicator calculations. This is
useful in order to have a single
place to change values that might
change over time.
Constants are applied AFTER
data element values have been
aggregated.
307
Configure metadata About indicators
Indicator element Type Description
Data elements Component Data elements are substituted by
the data value captured for the
data element.
Days Operator "Days" is special operator that
always provides the number of
days for a given indicator
calculation.
For example: if you want to
calculate the "Percentage of time
vaccine refrigerator was non-
functional", you could define the
numerator as:
("Days-"Number of days vaccine
refrigerator was
available"")/"Days"
If the fridge was available 25
days in June, the indicator would
be calculated as:
(30-25/25)*100 = 17 %
If you want to calculate the total
for Quarter 1, the number of days
("Days") would be:
31+28+31 = 90
The "Days" parameter will always
be the number of days in the
period of interest.
Organisation unit counts Component You can use organisation unit
groups in formulas. They will be
replaced by the number of
organisation units in the group.
During aggregation, the
organisation units in the group
will be intersected with the part of
the organisation unit hierarchy
being requested.
This lets you use the number of
public facilities in a specific
district in indicators. This is useful
for example when you create
facility infrastructure surveys and
reports.

Create or edit an indicator type
Indicator types define a factor that is applied during aggregation. Indicator values that are calculated
during a data mart export or report table generation process will appear properly formatted, and will
therefore not require an additional multiplier (for example 100 in the case of percent) for the values to
appear correctly formatted.
Note
As of version 2.4 of DHIS2, the "Calculated data element" object has been
deprecated. Instead, you can create a calculated data element by creating
an indicator type with a factor of "1" and by setting the "Number" option to
"Yes". The effect of setting the "Number" option to "Yes" will be that the
indicator will effectively not have a denominator. You will therefore only be
able to define a numerator, which will serve as the formula of the calculated
data element.
1. Open the Maintenance app and click Indicator > Indicator type.
2. Click the add button.
3. In the Name field, type the name of the indicator type, for example "Per cent", "Per thousand",
"Per ten thousand".
4. Type a Factor.

9. If you want to apply an annualization factor during the calculation of the indicator, select 
Annualized.
Typically, an annualized indicator's numerator is multiplied by a factor of 12, and the
denominator is for instance a yearly population figure. This allows for monthly coverage values
to be calculated with yearly population figures.
10. Select the number of Decimals in data output.
11. Select an Indicator type.
This field determines a factor that will automatically be applied during the calculation of the

About organisation units
The organisation unit hierarchy defines the organisation structure of DHIS2, for example how health
facilities, administrative areas and other geographical areas are arranged with respect to each other. It
is the where dimension of DHIS2, similar to how periods represent the when dimension.
The organisation unit hierarchy is built up by parent-child relations. In DHIS2, each of these nodes is
an organisation unit. A country might for example have eight provinces, and each province might have
a number of districts as children. Normally, the lowest levels consist of facilities where data is
collected. Data collecting facilities can also be located at higher levels, for example national or
provincial hospitals. Therefore, you can create skewed organisation trees in DHIS2.
• You can only have one organisation hierarchy at the same time.
• You can have any number of levels in a hierarchy.
Typically national organisation hierarchies in public health have four to six levels.
• You can create additional classifications by using organisation groups and organisation group
sets.
For example to create parallel administrative boundaries to the health care sector.
• It is recommended to use organisation unit groups to create a non-geographical hierarchy.
• An organisation unit can only be a member of a single organisation unit group within an
organisation unit group set.
• An organisation unit group can be part of multiple organisation unit group sets.
• The organisation unit hierarchy is the main vehicle for data aggregation on the geographical
dimension.
• When you close an organisation unit, you can't register or edit events to this organisation unit in
the Event Capture and Tracker Capture apps.
Important
You can change the organisation unit hierarchy after you've created it, even
organisation units that collect data. However, DHIS2 always uses the latest
hierarchy for data aggregation. So if you change the hierarchy, you loose
the temporal representation of the hierarchy across time.
District A is sub-divided into District B and District C. Facilities which
belonged to District A are reassigned to District B and C. Any historical
data, which you entered before the split occurred, is still registered as
belonging to District B and C, not to the obsolete District A.

6. (Optional) Select Include subhierarchy in analytics.
If you select this, a sub-organisation unit will inherit the organisation unit group property from its
closest "parent" organisation unit. Any property on the sub-organisation unit will override the
inherit value.
If an organisation unit have no associated organisation unit group, the organisation unit can
inherit its closest parent's organisation unit group. If none of the parent organisation unit groups
have an organisation unit group for a given org unit group set, the result will still be "blank", but
if at least one parent has an organisation unit group, sub-organisation unit will inherit it.

Manage validation rules
About validation rules
A validation rule is based on an expression. The expression defines a relationship between data
element values. The expression forms a condition with certain logical criteria.
The expression consists of:
• A left side
• A right side
• An operator
A validation rule asserting that the total number of vaccines given to infants is less than or equal to the
total number of infants.
328
Configure metadata About validation rules
The left and right sides must return numeric values.
In the Maintenance app, you manage the following validation rule objects:
Object type What you can do
Validation rule Create, edit, clone, delete, show details, and
translate
Validation rule group Create, edit, clone, delete, share, show details, and
translate
Validation notification Create, edit, clone, delete, show details, and

About sliding windows
You can use sliding windows to group data across multiple periods as opposed to selecting data for a
single period. Sliding windows have a size, that is to say, the number of days to cover, a starting point
and an end point. The example below shows disease surveillance data:.
• The data in the orange section, selects data based on the current period. There is a threshold,
which is calculated once for each week or period, and this is shown in the "Result" section.
• The data in the blue section is the sliding window. It selects data from the past 7 days. The
"Result" shows the total number of confirmed cases of a disease.
• The validation rule makes sure users are notified when the total number of cases breaks the
threshold for the period.
Different behaviour of validation rules
With sliding windows Without sliding windows
Used only for event data. Used for event data and aggregate data.
Data selection is based on a fixed number of days Data selection is always based on a period.
(periodType).
The position of the sliding window is always relative Data is always selected for the same period as the
to the period being compared. period being compared.
See also: How to use sliding windows when you're Creating or editing a validation rule.

Configure metadata About validation rules
About validation rule groups
A validation rule group allows you to group related validation rules. When you run a validation rule
analysis, you can choose to run all of the validation rules in your system, or just the validation rules in
one group.
About validation notifications
You can configure a validation rule analysis to automatically send notifications about validation errors
to selected user groups. These messages are called validation notifications. They are sent via the
internal DHIS2 messaging system.
You can send validation rule notifications as individual messages or as message summaries. This is
useful, for example, if you want to send individual messages for high-priority disease outbreaks, and
summaries for low-priority routine data validation errors.
About validation rule functions
You can use the following functions in a validation rule left side or right side:
Validation Rule functions
Validation Rule Function Arguments Description
if (boolean-expr, true-expr, false- Evaluates the boolean expression
expr) and if true returns the true
expression value, if false returns
the false expression value. The
arguments must follow the rules
for any indicator expression.
isNull (element) Returns true if the element value
is missing (null), otherwise false.
isNotNull (element) Returns true if the element value
is not missing (not null),
otherwise false.
firstNonNull (element [, element ...]) Returns the value of the first
element that is not missing (not
null). Can be provided any
number of arguments. Any
argument may also be a numeric
or string literal, which will be
returned if all the previous objects
have missing values.
greatest (expression [, expression ...]) Returns the greatest (highest)
value of the expressions given.
Can be provided any number of
arguments.
least (expression [, expression ...]) Returns the least (lowest) value
of the expressions given. Can be
provided any number of
arguments.
330
Configure metadata Create or edit a validation rule
Validation Rule Function Arguments Description
log (expression [, base ]) Returns the natural logarithm
(base e) of the numeric
expression. If an integer is given
as a second argument, returns
the logarithm using that base.
log10 (expression) Returns the common logarithm
(base 10) of the numeric
expression.
orgUnit.ancestor (orgUnitUid [, orgUnitUid ...]) Returns true if the organisation
unit is a descendant of any of the
(1 or more) organisation units,
otherwise false.
orgUnit.group (ouGroupUid [, ouGroupUid ...]) Returns true if the organisation
unit is a member of any of the (1
or more) organisation unit groups,
otherwise false.

8. Select an Operator: Compulsory pair, Equal to, Exclusive pair, Greater than, Greater than
or equal to or Not equal to.
The Compulsory pair operator allows to require that data values must be entered for a form for
both left and right sides of the expression, or for neither side. This means that you can require
that if one field in a form is filled, then one or more other fields must also be filled.
The Exclusive pair allows to assert that if any value exist on the left side then there should be
no values on the right side (or vice versa). This means that data elements which compose the
rule on either side should be mutually exclusive from each other, for a given time period /
organisation unit /attribute option combo.

About predictors
A predictor defines how to generate an aggregate data value from an expression containing aggregate
and/or event data. The predicted value may be based on:
• Data from the same period as the predicted value, and/or
• Data from periods previous to the predicted value
Data from the same period
A predictor can use data from the same period as the predicted value. For example, you can count the
number of organisation units having a non-zero value of a data element by using a predictor
expression such as:
if( #{ji7o0ILHuU2} != 0, 1, 0 )
When you run this predictor at the organisation unit level where the data is collected, it will store 1 as
the predicted value if the data element has a nonzero value for that organisation unit, otherwise 0. (If
the data element that you predict into does not store zeros, then zeors will not be stored in the
database, to save space.) You can then sum this predicted value in analytics at a higher organisation
unit level, to count the number of organisation units with a nonzero value that are under each
organisation unit in the report.
Data from previous periods
A predictor will use data from previous periods when you specify an aggregation function such as
sum() or avg(). For example, the following generator expression identifies a value that is the average
plus twice the standard deviation of previous period data:
avg( #{ji7o0ILHuU2} ) + 2 * stddev( #{ji7o0ILHuU2} )
Data from the same and previous periods
A predictor expression can access data both from same period as the prediction and previous periods
by accessing data both within an agregate function (for previous periods), and outside any aggregate
function (for the same period). For example, an expression like the following can be used to take a
balance of something from the previous period (#{KOh02hHko7C}), add to that the net change in this
period (#{ji7o0ILHuU2}), resulting in the balance for this period:
348
Configure metadata About predictors
sum( #{KOh02hHko7C} ) + #{ji7o0ILHuU2}
The first data value is inside an aggregate expression (sum) to indicate that it is sampling previous
period data (even if there is only one previous period), while the second data value is not in an
aggreate function to indicate that it is referencing data from the same period.
If you want to, a predictor's output data element can be referenced in the same predictor's expression.
For instance, the expression in this example could be used to predict the balance in a period, and then
combine that value with the change in the next period to compute the balance for the next period.
When a predictor is run across multiple periods, the periods are processed in chronological order, and
the result from an earlier period may be used as input for a later period.
Predictor organisation unit levels
You need to select one or more organisation unit levels for a predictor's output. All values generated
by the predictor are stored for organisation units at the level(s) you select. Each item in the predictor
expression is the sum of the value stored for that organisation unit (if any) plus any values stored in
organisation units below that one (if any).
Note
In configuring a predictor, you must choose one or more organisation unit
levels at which predicted data will be output. If no level is selected, no
predicted values will be generated.
Warning
If you want to use the predicted values in analytics reporting, or to make
other predictions, do not select more than one organisation unit level. When
you select more than one level, predictions at the higher level(s) will also
include any data used in lower level(s) predictions. If the predictions from
multiple levels are subsequently used in analytics, or in the expressions of
other predictors, this can result in double counting because the predicted
values for a higher level include the predicted values from a lower level.
You may select multiple organisation unit levels if you use the predicted values only in validation rules.
For example in disease surveillance, you could have a validation rule alert if an actual value is higher
than the range of expected values for that period based on previous period data. To do this, you could
create a predictor to compute the average plus twice the standard deviation of previous period data.
You could use a validation rule to compare this higest expected value with the actual value. You could
run the predictor and validation rule at multiple levels to detect different outbreak scenarios. In one
scenario, there might be a significant increase in one facility that exceeds its expected range, but the
district containing that facility might not exceed its expected range because the district values are
combined with many other facilities. Yet in another scenario, there may be a moderate increase in
several facilities that does not exceed the expected range for each facility (because the standard
deviation for each facility may be high), but it does exceed the expected range for the district (because
the standard deviation for the district as a whole may be lower).
349
Configure metadata Sampling previous periods
If you want to generate predictions at multiple levels, you could also use different predictors at different
levels. For example, you might want to be alerted if the value at one level exceeds the average plus
twice the standard deviation, but alerted at another level if it exceeds the average plus 1.8 times the
standard deviation. If you want, you could configure the different predictors to have the same output
data element. If you use the same output data element, this will still work with validaiton rules at
different organisaiton unit levels, but you also must be careful not to use the results in analytics or in
other predictor calculations to avoid double counting.
In the Maintenance app, you manage the following predictor objects:

Sampling previous periods
Predictors can generate data values for periods that are in the past, present, or future. These values
are based on data from the predicted period, and/or sampled data from periods previous to the
predicted period.
If you need data only from the same period in which the prediction is made, then you don't need to
read this section. This section describes how to sample data from periods previous to the predicted
period.
Sequential sample count
A predictor's Sequential sample count gives the number of immediate previous periods to sample. For
example, if a predictor's period type is Weekly and the Sequential sample count is 4, this means to
sample four previous weeks immediately preceding the predicted value week. So the predicted value
for week 9 would use samples from weeks 5, 6, 7, and 8:
If a predictor's period type is Monthly and the Sequential sample count is 4, this means to sample four
previous months immediately preceding the predicted value month. So the predicted value for May
would use samples from weeks January, February, March, and April:
The Sequential sample count can be greater than the number of periods in a year. For example, if you
want to sample the 24 months immediately preceding the predicted value month, set the Sequential
sample count to 24:
350
Configure metadata Sampling previous periods
Sequential skip count
A predictor's Sequential skip count tells how many periods should be skipped immediately previous to
the predicted value period, within the Sequential sample count. This could be used, for instance, in
outbreak detection to skip one or more immediately preceding samples that might in fact contain
values from the beginning of an outbreak that you are trying to detect.
For example, if the Sequential sample count is 4, but the Sequential skip count is 2, then the two
samples immediately preceding the predicted period will be skipped, resulting in only two periods
being sampled:
Annual sample count
A predictor's Annual sample count gives the number of previous years for which samples should be
collected at the same time of year. This could be used, for instance, for disease surveillance in cases
where the expected incidence of the disease varies during the year and can best be compared with
the same relative period in previous years. For example, if the Annual sample count is 2 (and the 
Sequential sample count is zero), then samples would be collected from periods in the immediately
preceding two years, at the same time of year.
Sequential and annual sample counts together
You can use the sequential and annual sample counts together to collect samples from a number of
sequential periods over a number of past years. When you do this, samples will be collected in
previous years during the period at the same time of year as the predicted value period, and also in
previous years both before and after the same time of year, as determined by the Sequential sample
count number.
For example, if the Sequential sample count is 4 and the Annual sample count is 2, samples will be
collected from the 4 periods immediately preceding the predicted value period. In addition samples will
be collected in the previous 2 years for the corresponding period, as well as 4 periods on either side:
351
Configure metadata Create or edit a predictor
Sequential, annual, and skip sample counts together
You can use the Sequential skip count together with the sequential and annual sample counts. When
you do this, the Sequential skip count tells how many periods to skip in the same year as the predicted
value period. For example, if the Sequential sample count is 4 and the Sequential skip count is 2, then
the two periods immediately preceding the predicted value period period will be skipped, but the two
periods before that will be sampled:
If the Sequential skip count is equal to or greater than the Sequential sample count, then no samples
will be collected for the year containing the predicted value period; only periods from past years will be
sampled:
Sample skip test
You can use the Sample skip test to skip samples from certain periods that would otherwise be
included, based on the results of testing an expression within those periods. This could be used, for
instance, in disease outbreak detection, where the sample skip test could identify previous disease
outbreaks, to exclude those samples from the prediction of a non-outbreak baseline expected value.
The Sample skip test is an expression that should return a value of true or false, to indicate whether or
not the period should be skipped. It can be an expression that tests any data values in the previous
period. For example, it could test for a data value that was explicitly entered to indicate that a previous
period should be skipped. Or it could compare a previously predicted value for a period with the actual
value recorded for that period, to determine if that period should be skipped.
Any periods for which the Sample skip test is true will not be sampled. For example:

3. In the Name field, type the predictor name.
4. (Optional) In the Code field, assign a code.
5. (Optional) Type a Description.
6. Select an Output data element. Values generated by this predictor are stored as aggregate
data associated with this data element and the predicted period.
The value is rounded according to the value type of the data element: If the value type is an
integer type, the predicted value is rounded to the nearest integer. For all other value types, the
number is rounded to four significant digits. (However if there are more than four digits to the
left of the decimal place, they are not replaced with zeros.)
7. (Optional) Select an Output category combo. This dropdown will only show if the selected
data element has categoryCombos attached to it. If this is the case, you can select which
categoryCombo you would like to use.
8. Select a Period type.
9. Assign one or more organisation unit levels. The output value will be assigned to an
organisation unit at this level (or these levels). The input values will come from the organisation
unit to which the output is assigned, or from any level lower under the output organisation unit.
10. Create a Generator. The generator is the expression that is used to calculate the predicted
value.
1. Type a Description of the generator expression.
2. Select a Missing value strategy. This selection sets how the system evaluates a
validation rule if data is missing.
Option Description
Skip if any value is missing The validation rule will be skipped if any of
the values which compose the expression
are missing. This is the default option.
Always select this option you use the Exclus
ive pair or Compulsory pair operator.
Skip if all values are missing The validation rule will be skipped only if all
of the values which compose it are missing.
Never skip The validation rule will never be skipped in
case of missing data, and all missing values
will be treated effectively as a zero.
3. Enter the generator expression. You can build the expression by selecting data elements
for aggregate data, or program data elements, attributes or indicators. Organisation unit
counts are not yet supported.
To use sampled, past period data, you should enclose any items you select in one of the
following aggregate functions (note that these function names are case-sensitive):
Aggregate function Means
avg(x) Average (mean) value of x
353
Configure metadata Create or edit a predictor
Aggregate function Means
count(x) Count of the values of x
max(x) Maximum value of x
median(x) Median value of x
min(x) Minimum value of x
percentileCont(p, x) Continuous percentile of x, where p is the
percentile as a floating point number between
0 and 1. For example, p = 0 will return the
lowest value, p = 0.5 will return the median, p
th
= 0.75 will return the 75  percentile, p = 1 will
return the highest value, etc. Continuous
means that the value will be interpolated if
necessary. For example, percentileCont( 0.5,
#{FTRrcoaog83} ) will return 2.5 if the
sampled values of data element
FTRrcoaog83 are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
stddev(x) Standard deviation of x. This function is
eqivalent to stddevSamp. It's suggested that
you use the function stddevSamp instead for
greater clarity.
stddevPop(x) Population standard deviation of x: sqrt(
sum( (x - avg(x))^2 ) / n )
stddevSamp(x) Sample standard deviation of x: sqrt( sum( (x
- avg(x))^2 ) / ( n - 1 ) ). Note that this value is
not computed when there is only one sample.
sum(x) Sum of the values of x
Note
Any items inside an aggregate function will be evaluated for all sampled
past periods, and then combined according to the formula inside the
aggregate function. Any items outside an aggregate function will be
evaluated for the period in which the prediction is being made.
You can build more complex expressions by clicking on (or typing) any of the elements
below the expression field: ( ) * / + - Days. Constant numbers may be added by typing
them. The Days option inserts [days] into the expression which resolves to the number of
days in the period from which the data came.
You can also use the following non-aggregating functions in your expression, either
inside aggregate functions, or containing aggregate functions, or independent of
aggregate functions:
Function Means
if(test, valueIfTrue, valueIfFalse) Evaluates test which is an expression that
evaluates to a boolean value -- see Boolean
expression notes below. If the test is true,
returns the valueIfTrue expression. If it is fal
se, returns the valueIfFalse expression.

isNotNull(item) Returns true if the item value is not missing
(not null), otherwise false.
firstNonNull(item [, item ...]) Returns the value of the first item that is not
missing (not null). Can be provided any
number of arguments. Any argument may
also be a numeric or string literal, which will
be returned if all the previous items have
missing values.

expressions given. Can be provided any
number of arguments.
least(expression [, expression ...]) Returns the least (lowest) value of the
expressions given. Can be provided any

log(expression [, base ]) Returns the natural logarithm (base e) of the
numeric expression. If an integer is given as
a second argument, returns the logarithm
using that base.
log10(expression) Returns the common logarithm (base 10) of
the numeric expression.
orgUnit.ancestor(orgUnitUid [, orgUnitUid ...]) Returns true if the organisation unit is a
descendant of any of the (1 or more)
organisation units, otherwise false.
orgUnit.group(ouGroupUid [, ouGroupUid ...]) Returns true if the organisation unit is a
member of any of the (1 or more)
organisation unit groups, otherwise false.
Boolean expression notes: A boolean expression must evaluate to true or false. The
following operators may be used to compare two values resulting in a boolean
expression: \<, >, !=, ==, >=, and \<=. The following operators may be used to combine
two boolean expressions: && (logical and), and || (logical or). The unary operator ! may
be used to negate a boolean expression.

Manage push reports
About push reports
Push reports allows you to increase awareness and usage of data analysis by sending reports with
charts, tables and maps directly to users e-mail addresses.
• A push report gets its content from existing dashboards.
• A push report lists the dashboard items in the same order as on the dashboard.
358
Configure metadata About push reports
A push report can only contain dashboard items with charts, maps or tables.
• 
• You create the push report and its schedule in the Maintenance app.
• The Title and Message parameters you set up in the Maintenance app, are included in each
report. The Name you give the report is not included in the report. Instead, the name is used to
identify the push analysis object in the system. This way a report can be named one thing, and
the title of the report can be another.
• When you run a push report job, the system compiles a list of recipients from the user groups
you've selected. The system then generates a report for each member of the selected user
groups. Each of the dashboard items are generated specifically for each user. This means that
the data included in the report reflects the data the user has access to. All users could therefore
get the same report (if all the data is "static") or custom reports (if all the data is "dynamic"), or a
combination of the two.
• Push reports are sent by e-mail to the recipients, not through the internal DHIS2 messaging
system. If a user doesn't have a valid e-mail, or if the job fails, no e-mails are sent. In this case,
the problem is logged on the server.
Note
The data generated in the push reports is public so verify that you don't
include any sensitive data.

About external map layers
You can customize GIS by including map layers from various sources and combine them with your
own data in DHIS2. DHIS2 supports common map service formats such as Web Map Service (WMS),
Tile Map Service (TMS) and XYZ tiles.
Create or edit an external map layer
Note
DHIS2 only supports the Web Mercator projection (EPSG:3857) so make
sure that the external service supports this projection.

Manage SQL Views
The SQL View functionality of DHIS2 will store the SQL view definition internally, and then materialize
the view when requested.
Database administrators must be careful about creating database views directly in the DHIS2
database. For instance, when the resource tables are generated, all of them will first be dropped and
then re-created. If any SQL views depend on these tables, an integrity violation exception will be
thrown and the process will be aborted.
The SQL views are dropped in reverse alphabetical order based on their names in DHIS2, and created
in regular alphabetical order. This allows you to have dependencies between SQL views, given that
views only depend on other views which come earlier in the alphabetical order. For instance, "ViewB"
can safely depend on "ViewA". Otherwise, having views depending on other view result in an integrity
violation error.
Creating a new SQL view
To create a new SQL view, click Apps > Maintenance > Other > SQL View and click the Add +
button.
365
Configure metadata SQL views that call other SQL views
The "Name" attribute of the SQL view will be used to determine the name of the table that DHIS2 will
create when the view is materialized by the user. The "Description" attribute allows one to provide
some descriptive text about what the SQL view actually does.
The "SQL type" attribute allows the creation of three kinds of views:
• A "View" is stored in the database and regenerated when queried
• A "Materialized View" is stored in the database and its results are cached in the database
• A "Query" is not stored in the database
Finally, the "SQL query" should contain the SQL view definition.
Only SQL "SELECT" statements are allowed and certain sensitive tables (i.e., user information) are
not accessible.
Press "Save" to store the SQL view definition. If you created a "View" or a "Materialized View", you
must also "Execute query" to finish the creation of the SQL view.
Keep in mind that the the columns returned by the used SELECT statement become table columns,
that means they must be of a valid table column type. When functions are used it might be necessary
to explicitly cast the result to a type by adding ::{TYPE} after the function.
For example, instead of jsonb_each (which would return a record type that cannot be a column type)
use jsonb_each_text and cast the result to text, like in the below sample:
select jsonb_each_text(eventdatavalues)::text from ...
SQL views that call other SQL views
If you wish to make a SQL view that can be called be other SQL views, then its SQL type must be
either "View" or a "Materialized View" (not "Query"). It also must have Execute query run on it before
being called.
366
Configure metadata SQL View management
For instance, if you created a view named Data element count with SQL type "View" and this SQL:
select count(*) as count from dataelement;
...then you could run Execute query from the context menu and create a second SQL view named 
More than 100 data elements with this SQL:
select case when count > 100 then 1 else 0 end as result from _view_data_element_count;
SQL View management
In order to utilize the SQL views, simply click the view and from the context menu, choose "Execute
query". Once the process is completed, you will be informed that a table has been created. The name
of the table will be provided, and is composed from the "Description" attribute provided in the SQL
view definition. Once the view has been generated, you can view it by clicking the view again, and
selecting "Show SQL View".
Tip
If you have a view which depends on another view, you should be careful
about how the views are named. When analytics is run on the DHIS2
server, all views must be dropped, and are recreated. When analytics
starts, the views are dropped in alphabetical order, and then recreated in
reverse alphabetical order. Thus, if view A depends on view B, it must
appear before view B in alphabetical order. If it appears after view B in
alphabetical order, analytics may fail, as the view with dependencies will not
be dropped in the correct order.
Manage Locales
It is possible to create custom locales in DHIS2. In addition to the locales available through the
system, you might want to add a custom locale such as "English" and "Zambia" to the system. This
would allow you to translate metadata objects to local languages, or to account for slight variants
between countries which use a common metadata definition.
The locale is composed of a language along with a country. Select the desired values and press
"Add". This custom locale will now be available as one of the translation locales in the system.

About programs
Traditionally, public health information systems have been reporting aggregated data of service
provision across its health programs. This does not allow you to trace the people provided with these
services. In DHIS2, you can define your own programs with stages. These programs are a essential
part of the "tracker" functionality which lets you track individual records. You can also track other
‘entities’ such as wells or insurances. You can create two types of programs:
Program types

Configure event programs in the Maintenance app
About event programs
Single event without registration programs are called event programs. You configure them in the 
Maintenance app. Event programs can have three types of data entry forms:
Types of data entry forms for event programs
Form type Description
Basic Lists all data elements which belong to the program.
You can change the order of the data elements.
Section A section groups data elements. You can then
arrange the order of the sections to create the
desired layout of the data entry form.
Custom Defines the data entry form as HTML page.
Note
• Custom forms takes precedence over section forms if both are
present.
• If no custom or section form are defined, the basic form will be used.
• The Android apps only supports section forms.
You can create program notifications for event programs. The notifications are sent either via the
internal DHIS2 messaging system, via e-mail or via text messages (SMS). You can use program
notifications to, for example, send an automatic reminder to a tracked entity 10 days before a
scheduled appointment. You use the program’s tracked entity attributes (for example first name) and
program parameters (for example enrollment date) to create a notification template. In the 
Parameters field, you'll find a list of available tracked entity attributes and program parameters.

- Point A point/coordinate is captured. For single
event programs the point will be representing the
event being captured. For tracker programs, the
point will represent the enrollment.
Validation strategy Sets the server and client side validation
requirement. 
Data type validation is always performed
regardless of the validation strategy. An integer
field is never stored containing text, for example. 
- On complete This option will enforce required
field and error messages to be fixed when
completing the event, but the event can be saved
to the server without passing these validation
requirements. For legacy reasons, this is always
the validation strategy for tracker programs,
where each data value in the event is stored to
the server while entering data. 
- On update and insert This option will enforce
required field validation when saving the event to
the server regardless of the completion status.
When using this option no events can be stored
without passing validations.

Completed events expiry days Defines the number of days for which you can edit a
completed event. This means that when an event is
completed and the specified number of expiry days
has passed, the event is locked. 
If you set "Completed events expiry days" to 10", an
event is locked ten days after the completion date.
After this date you can no longer edit the event.
Expiry period type The expiry days defines for how many days after the
end of the previous period, an event can be edited.
Expiry days The period type is defined by the expiry period type.
This means that when the specified number of expiry
days has passed since the end date of the previous
period, the events from that period are locked. 
If you set the expiry type to "Monthly" and the expiry
days to "10" and the month is October, then you can't

About program indicators
Program indicators are expressions based on data elements and attributes of tracked entities which
can be used to calculate values based on a formula. Program indicators consist of an aggregation
type, an analytics type, an expression and a filter.
Program indicators are evaluated based on the assigned aggregation type, expression and filter. The
order of evaluation is:
1. The filter will filter the events which become part of the evaluation/aggregation routine.
2. The expression will be evaluated per event.
3. All evaluated expression values will be aggregated according to the aggregation type of the
program indicator.
Program indicator components
Program rule component Description
Aggregation type The aggregation type determines how the program
indicator will be aggregated. The following
aggregation types are available:
_ Average
_ Average (number)
_ Average (number, disaggregation)
_ Average (sum in organisation unit hierarchy)
_ Average (sum of numbers)
_ Average (sum of numbers, disaggregation)
_ Average (Yes/No)
_ Count
_ Custom
The "custom" aggregation type allows you to specify
the aggregation type in-line in the expression. All
other aggregation types are applied to the entire
expression.
Using the "custom" aggregation type might lead to an
exception of the order of evaluation described above
where individual parts of the expression can be
evaluated and aggregated, as opposed to the entire
expression being evaluated prior to aggregation.
_ Default
_ Max
_ Min
_ None
_ Standard deviation
_ Sum
_ Variance

Configure programs in the Maintenance app About program indicators
Program rule component Description
Analytics type The available analytics types are event and enrollm
ent.
The analytics type defines whether the program
indicator is calculated based on events or program
enrollments. This has an impact on what type of
calculations can be made.
_ Events implies a data source where each event
exists as an independent row. This is suitable for
performing aggregations such as counts and sums.
_ Enrollments implies a data source where all events
for a single enrollment is combined on the same row.
This allows for calculations which can compare event
data from various program stages within a program
enrollment.
395
Configure programs in the Maintenance app About program indicators
Analytics period boundaries Defines the boundaries for the program indicator
calculation. The boundaries determine which events
or enrollments gets included in aggregations, always
relative to the aggregate reporting period start and
end. When creating the program indicator, the
default boundaries will get preselected based on
analytics type.
* For analytics type event, the default boundaries will
be configured to encapsulate any events with an
event date after the reporting period starts and
before the reporting period ends.
* For analytics type enrollment, the default
boundaries will encapsulate all enrollments with an
enrollment date after the reporting date starts and
before the reporting period ends. In addition, the
default enrollment program indicator evaluates the
newest event for all program stages regardless of
date.
It is possible to change the upper and lower
boundaries to include a longer or shorter period
relative to the reporting period, or delete one of the
boundaries - in effect returning all data before or
after a certain period. It is also possible to add more
constraints, for example to make an enrollment
program indicator only include event data up to a
given point in time.
* Boundary target: Can be incident date, event date, 
enrollment date or custom. Designates what is being
constrained by the boundary.
custom is used make boundary that target either a
date data element, tracked entity attribute or the
presence of an event in a program stage. This is
done with a custom expression on the form:
- Data element of type date:
#{programStageUid.dataElementUid}.
#{A03MvHHogjR.a3kGcGDCuk6} 
- Tracked entity attribute of type date: #{attributeUid}.
A{GPkGfbmArby} 
- Presence of one event in a specific program stage:
PS_EVENTDATE:programStageUid.
PS_EVENTDATE:A03MvHHogjR 
Note This boundary target is only applicable to
Analytics type Enrollment 
* Analytics period boundary type: Defines whether
the boundary is an end boundary - starting with
"before...", or a start boundary - "after...". Also
defines whether the boundary relates to the end of
the aggregate reporting period or the start of the
aggregate reporting period.
_ Offset period by amount: In some cases, for
example cohort analytics, the boundary should be
offset relative to the aggregate reporting period when
running pivots and reports. The offset period by
396 amount is used to move the current boundary either
back(negative) or forward(positive) in time. The
amount and period type together will determine how
big the offset will be. An example can be when
making a simple enrollment cohort program indicator
for a 1 year cohort, it might be enough to offset each
boundary of the program indicator with "-1" and
"Years"
_ Period type: See above. Can be any period, e.g. W
eekly or Quarterly.
Configure programs in the Maintenance app About program indicators
Program rule component Description
Expression The expression defines how the indicator is being
calculated. The expression can contain references to
various entities which will be substituted with a
related values when the indicator is calculated:
_ Data elements: Will be substituted with the value of
the data element for the time period and organisation
unit for which the calculation is done. Refers to both
program stage and data element.
_ Attributes: Will be substituted with the value of the
attribute for the person / tracked entity for which the
calculation is done.
_ Variables: Will be substituted with special values
linked to the program, including incident date and
date of enrollment for the person, current date and
count of values in the expression for the time period
and organisation unit for which the calculation is
done.
_ Constants: Will be substituted with the value of the
constant.
The expression is a mathematical expression and
can also contain operators.
For single event programs and tracker programs with
analytics type event, the expression will be evaluated
per event, then aggregated according to its
aggregation type.
For tracker programs with analytics type enrollment,
the expression will be evaluated per enrollment, then
aggregated according to its aggregation type.
Filter The filter is applied to events and filters the data
source used for the calculation of the indicator. I.e.
the filter is applied to the set of events before the
indicator expression is being evaluated. The filter
must evaluate to either true or false. It filter is applied
to each individual event. If the filter evaluates to true
then the event is included later in the expression
evaluation, if not it is ignored. The filter can, in a
similar way as expressions, contain references to
data elements, attributes and constants.
The program indicator filter can in addition use
logical operators. These operators can be used to
form logical expressions which ultimately evaluate to
either true or false. For example you can assert that
multiple data elements must be a specific value, or
that specific attributes must have numerical values
less or greater than a constant.

An expression that includes both attributes, data elements and constants looks like this:
(A{GPkGfbmArby} + #{mCXR7u4kNBW.NFkjsNiQ9PH}) * C{bCqvfPR02Im}
An expression which uses the custom aggregation type and hence can use inline aggregation types
looks like this:
(sum(#{mCXR7u4kNBW.K0A4BauXJDl} * #{mCXR7u4kNBW.NFkjsNiQ9PH}) / 
sum(#{mCXR7u4kNBW.NFkjsNiQ9PH})) * 100

== Equal to
!= Not equal to
< Less than
<= Less than or equal to
> Greater than
>= Greater than or equal to
These operators can be used to form logical expressions which ultimately evaluate to either true or
false. For example you can assert that multiple data elements must be a specific value, or that specific
attributes must have numerical values less or greater than a constant.
A filter that uses both attributes and data elements looks like this:
A{cejWyOfXge6} == 'Female' and #{A03MvHHogjR.a3kGcGDCuk6} <= 2

About program rules
Program rules allows you to create and control dynamic behaviour of the user interface in the Tracker
Capture and Event Capture apps. During data entry, the program rules expressions are evaluated
407
Configure programs in the Maintenance app Workflow
each time the user interface is displayed, and each time a data element is changed. Most types of
actions will take effect immediately when the user enters values in the Tracker Capture and Event
Capture apps.
Program rule components
Program rule component Description
Program rule action Each program rule contains one or multiple actions.
These are the behaviours that are triggered in the
user interface when the expression is true. Actions
will be applied at once if the expression is true, and
will be reverted if the expression is no longer true.
There are several types of actions and you can have
several actions in one program rule.
Program rule expression Each program rule has a single expression that
determines whether the program rule actions should
be triggered, if the expression evaluates to true. If
the expression is true the program rule is in effect
and the actions will be executed. If the expression is
false, the program rule is no longer in effect and the
actions will no longer be applied.
You create the expression with standard
mathematical operators, custom functions, user-
defined static values and program rule variables. The
program rule variables represent attribute and data
element values which will be evaluated as part of the
expression.
Program rule variable Program rule variables lets you include data values
and attribute values in program rule expressions.
Typically, you'll have to create one or several
program rule variables before creating a program
rule. This is because program rules expressions
usually contain at least one data element or attribute
value to be meaningful.
The program rule variables are shared between all
rules in your program. When you create multiple
program rules for the same program, these rules will
share the same library of program rule variables.
In the Maintenance app, you manage the following program rule objects:

In the Maintenance app, create the program rule:
2. 
1. Enter the program rule details.
2. Create the program rule expression.
3. Define the program rule actions.
3. In the Tracker Capture or Event Capture apps, verify that the program rule behaves as
expected.
Create or edit a program rule variable
1. Open the Maintenance app and click Program > Program rule variable.
2. Click the add button.
3. Select a Program and enter a Name.
4. Select if you want to Use code for option set.
This option is only effective when the data element or tracked entity attribute is connected to an
option set. If you don't select this option, the program rule variable will be populated with the
option set's name. If you select the option, the program rule variable will be populated with the
option set's code instead.
5. Select a Source type and enter the required information.
Depending on the source type, you'll have to select, for example, a Program stage, Data
element or Tracked entity attribute.
The source types determine how the program rule variable is populated with a value.
Source type Description
Data element from the newest event for a This source type works the same way as Data
program stage element from the newest event in the current
program, except that it only evaluates values
from one program stage.
This source type can be useful in program rules
where the same data element is used in several
program stages, and a rule needs to evaluate the
newest data value from within one specific stage.
409
Configure programs in the Maintenance app Create or edit a program rule variable
Source type Description
Data element from the newest event in the This source type is used when a program rule
current program variable needs to reflect the newest known value
of a data element, regardless of what event the
user currently has open.
This source type is populated slightly differently
in Tracker Capture and Event Capture apps:
Tracker Capture: the program rule variable will
be populated with the newest data value
collected for the given data element within the
enrollment.
Event Capture: the program rule variable will be
populated with the newest data value found
within the 10 newest events in the same
organisation unit.
The newest data value is determined with event
date.
Data element in current event Program rule variables with this source type will
contain the data value from the same event that
the user currently has open.
This is the most commonly used source type,
especially for skip logic (hide actions) and
warning/error rules.
410
Configure programs in the Maintenance app Create or edit a program rule variable
Source type Description
Data element from previous event Program rule variables with this source type will
contain the value from a specified data element
from a previous event. Only older events is
evaluated, not including the event that the user
currently has open.
This source type is commonly used when a data
element only should be collected once during an
enrollment, and should be hidden in subsequent
events.
Another use case is making rules for validating
input where there is an expected progression
from one event to the next - a rule can evaluate
whether the previous value is higher/lower and
give a warning if an unexpected value is entered.
This source type is populated slightly differently
in Tracker Capture and Event Capture apps:
Tracker Capture: the program rule variable will
be populated with the newest data value
collected for the given data element within the
enrollment - but only evaluating the events that
comes before the current event date.
Event Capture: the program rule variable will be
populated with the newest data value collected
within the 10 events preceding the current event
date - not including the current event.
The newest data value is determined with event
date.
Calculated value Program rule variable with this source type is not
connected directly to any form data - but will be
populated as a result of some other program
rules ASSIGN action.
This variable will be used for making preliminary
calculations, having a ASSIGN program rule
action and assigning a value, this value can be
used by other program rules - potentially making
the expressions simpler and more maintanable.
These variables will not be persisted and will stay
in memory only during the exectution of the set of
program rules. Any program rule that assigns a
data value to a preliminary calculated value
would normally also have a priority assigned - to
make sure that the preliminary caculation is done
before the rule that consumes the calculated
value.
411
Configure programs in the Maintenance app Create or edit a program rule
Source type Description
Tracked entity attribute Populates the program rule variable with a
specified tracked entity attribute for the current
enrollment.
Use this is the source type to create program
rules that evaluate data values entered during
registration.
This source type is also useful when you create
program rules that compare data in events to
data entered during registration.
This source type is only used for tracker
programs (programs with registration).

d2:floor( d2:daysBetween(#{lastMenstrualDate},V{event_date}) / 7 )
Tip
The source type will determine how the d2: function calls will evaluate a
(sourcefield) parameter.
Example: where #{hemoglobinCurrent} is set to source type Data element
in current event. The following function call with evaluate whether
haemoglobin is entered in the current event.
d2:hasValue( 'hemoglobinCurrent' )
Example: where #{hemoglobin} is set to source type Data element from
the newest event in the current program. The following function call with
evaluate whether there exists a value for the haemoglobin in any event in
the enrollment.
d2:hasValue( 'hemoglobin' )
Example: where #{hemoglobinPrevious} is set to source type Data element
from previous event . The following function call with evaluate whether
there exists a value for the haemoglobin among the events preceding the
current event.
d2:hasValue( 'hemoglobinPrevious' )

Configure relationship types
About relationship types
A relationship represents a link between two entities in the Tracker-model. A relationship is considered
data in DHIS2 and is based on a Relationship Type, similar to how a Tracked Entity Instance is based
on a Tracked Entity Type.
Relationships always include two entities, and these entities can include Tracked Entity Instances,
Enrollments and Events, and any combination of these. Note that not all of these combinations are
available in the current apps.
438
Configure programs in the Maintenance app Create or edit a relationship type
In addition, relationships can be defined as unidirectional or bidirectional. The only functional
difference is currently that these requires different levels of access to create. Unidirectional
relationships requires the user to have data write access to the “from” entity and data read access for
the “to” entity, while bidirectional relationships require data write access for both sides.
For more information about configuration and the meaning of 'From constraint' and 'To constraint', see 
Relationship model.
Create or edit a relationship type
1. Open the Maintenance app and click Program > Relationship type.
2. Click the add button.
3. Type a Name of the relationship type.
4. (Optional) Assign a Code.
5. (Optional) Provide a Description of the relationship.
6. (Optional) Select whether the relationship should be bidirectional
7. Provide Relationship name seen from inititating entity. This is the name of the relationship
that will be shown in the Data Entry app at the 'left' side of the relationship. E.g. in a Mother-
child relationship this could be 'Mother of'.
8. (Optional) Provide Relationship name seen from receiving entity. This is the name of the
relationship that will be shown at the 'right' side of the relationship in the Data Entry app. E.g. in
a Mother-child relationship this could be 'Mother'.

Configure tracked entity types
About tracked entity types
A tracked entity is a types of entities which can be tracked through the system. It can be anything from
persons to commodities, for example a medicine or a person.
A program must have one tracked entity. To enroll a tracked entity instance into a program, the tracked
entity type and tracked entity type of a program must be the same.
Tracked entity attributes are used to register extra information for a tracked entity. Tracked entity
attributes can be shared between programs.
Create or edit a tracked entity attribute

Configure programs in the Maintenance app Configure search for tracker program
Searching can be done either in the context of a program, or in the context of a tracked entity type. To
be give users the option of searching in the context of a program, it is necessary to configure which of
the programs tracked entity attributes is searchable. To give users the option of searching in the
context of a tracked entity type, you will have to configure which of the tracked entity type attributes is
searchable.
Configure search for tracker program
To be able to search with a program, you will have to make some of the program attributes
searchable. Unique program attributes will always be searchable.
1. Open Maintenance app and click Program
2. Open or create a Tracker program
3. Go to Attributes
4. If you have no attributes, add one
5. Set the attribute searchable
Searchable program attributes will assigned to a search group.
• Unique group. One group per unique program attribute. Unique attributes cannot be combined
with other program attributes in a search. The result from the search can only be 0 or 1 tracked
entity instance.
• Non-unique group. This group contains all non-unique program attributes and makes it possible
to combine multiple attributes in a search.
There are two limits that can be set for a program search, as part of the Program details
configuration.
• Minimum number of attributes required to search: This property defines how many of the non-
unique attributes that must be entered before a search can be performed.
• Maximum number of tracked entity instances to return: This property defines how specific a
search must be, by limiting the number of matching tracked entity instances a user is allowed to
get for her search criteria. If the number of matching records is larger than this maximum, they
will not be returned. The user must provide more specific search criteria, in order to reduce the
number of matching records, before they are returned.
NOTE
This maximum is only applied to search results outside the users capture org unit.
Within the capture scope, the user can see any number of results.

Warning
Any data set that you delete from the system is irrevocably lost. All data
entry forms, and section forms which may have been developed will also be
removed. Make sure that you have made a backup of your database before
deleting any data set in case you need to restore it at some point in time.
1. Open the Maintenance app and find the type of metadata object you want to delete.
2. In the object list, click the options menu and select Delete.
3. Click Confirm.
Change sharing settings for metadata objects
You can assign different sharing settings to metadata objects, for example organisation units and
tracked entity attributes. These sharing settings control which users and users groups that can view or
edit a metadata object.
Some metadata objects also allows you to change the sharing setting of data entry for the object.
These additional settings control who can view or enter data in form fields using the metadata.
Note
The default setting is that everyone (Public access) can find, view and edit
metadata objects.
1. Open the Maintenance app and find the type of metadata object you want to modify.
2. In the object list, click the context menu and select Sharing settings.
3. (Optional) Add users or user groups: search for a user or a user group and select it. The user or
user group is added to the list.
4. Change sharing settings for the access groups you want to modify.
◦ Can edit and view: The access group can view and edit the object.
◦ Can view only: The access group can view the object.
◦ No access (only applicable to Public access): The public won't have access to the
object.

About user management
Multiple users can access DHIS2 simultaneously and each user can have different authorities. You
can fine-tune these authorities so that certain users can only enter data, while others can only
generate reports.
• You can create as many users, user roles and user groups as you need.
• You can assign specific authorities to user groups or individual users via user roles.
• You can create multiple user roles each with their own authorities.
• You can assign user roles to users to grant the users the corresponding authorities.
• You can assign each user to organisation units. Then the user can enter data for the assigned
organisation units.
• You can set an expiration date to individual users

About users
Each user in DHIS2 must have a user account which is identified by a user name. You should register
a first and last name for each user as well as contact information, for example an email address and a
phone number.
It is important that you register the correct contact information. DHIS2 uses this information to contact
users directly, for example sending emails to notify users about important events. You can also use the
contact information to share for example dashboards and pivot tables.
A user in DHIS2 is associated with an organisation unit. You should assign the organisation unit where
the user works.
When you create a user account for a district record officer, you should assign the district where he/
she works as the organisation unit.
The assigned organisation unit affects how the user can use DHIS2:
• In the Data Entry app, a user can only enter data for the organisation unit she is associated
with and the organisation units below that in the hierarchy. For instance, a district records officer
will be able to register data for her district and the facilities below that district only.
• In the Users app, a user can only create new users for the organisation unit she is associated
with in addition to the organisation units below that in the hierarchy.
• In the Reports app, a user can only view reports for her organisation unit and those below.
(This is something we consider to open up to allow for comparison reports.)
An important part of user management is to control which users are allowed to create new users with
which authorities. In DHIS2, you can control which users are allowed to perform this task. The key
principle is that a user can only grant authorities and access to data sets that the user itself has
access to. The number of users at national, province and district level are often relatively few and can
be created and managed by the system administrators. If a large proportion of the facilities are
entering data directly into the system, the number of users might become unwieldy. It is recommended
to delegate and decentralize this task to the district officers, it will make the process more efficient and
support the facility users better.
About user roles
A user role in DHIS2 is a group of authorities. An authority means the permission to perform one or
more specific tasks.
A user role can contain authorities to create a new data element, update an organisation unit or view a
report.
A user can have multiple user roles. If so, the user's authorities will be the sum of all authorities and
data sets in the user roles. This means that you can mix and match user roles for special purposes
instead of only creating new ones.
A user role is associated with a collection of data sets. This affects the Data Entry app: a user can
only enter data for the data sets registered for his/her user role. This can be useful when, for example,
you want to allow officers from health programs to enter data only for their relevant data entry forms.
448
Manage users, user roles and user groups About user groups
Recommendations:
• Create one user role for each position within the organisation.
• Create the user roles in parallel with defining which user is doing which tasks in the system.
• Only give the user roles the exact authorities they need to perform their job, not more. Only
those who are supposed to perform a task should have the authorities to perform it.
About user groups
A user group is a group of users. You use user groups when you set up sharing of metadata objects or
notifications for example for reports or programs.

Workflow
1. Define the positions you need for your project and identify which tasks the different positions will
perform.
2. Create roughly one user role for each position.
3. Create users.
4. Assign user roles to the users.
5. Assign the users to organisation units.
6. (Optional) Group users in user groups.
7. Share datasets with users or user-groups via the Sharing Dialog in Data set management
section of the Maintenance app
Tip
For users to be able to enter data, you must add them to an organisational
unit level and share a dataset with them.
449
Manage users, user roles and user groups Manage users
Manage users
Create a user
1. Open the Users app and click on the + in the Users card.
2. Select whether you want to fill in all the personal user information, or invite the user by email to
complete the rest of the user information:
3. Create account with user details 
Choose this option if you would like to enter all the login details of the new user such as
username, password, etc. Under these conditions, the fields username, password, surname,
first name, and roles are mandatory.
After you've created the user, the account is ready for the user to use with the user name and
password that you provide.
450
Manage users, user roles and user groups Create a user
4. Email invitation to create account 
Choose this option if you want to send an invitation by email to the user. Then she/he must
return to DHIS2 and finish setting up their user account. The account that the user finishes
setting up will be limited according to how you configure the account.
Note
In order to use this feature the system should have a valid email
configuration in SystemSettings -> Email
Enter the email address to which the invitation should be sent. If you want to, you may also enter the
user name that the account will have. If you leave the user name empty, then the user may choose
their own user name when they respond to the invitation (as long as it is not taken already for another
user.)
After you've created the user, the system sends an email to the address you provided. It contains a
unique web link by which the user can return to the system and activate their account by entering the
rest of their user information. The user must finish setting up the account within 4 days, after that the
invitation becomes invalid.
1. (Optional) Provide values for the fields OIDC mapping claim, LDAP identifier, Mobile phone
number, WhatsApp, Facebook messenger, Skype, Telegram and Twitter.
2. Select an Interface language.
You can select a language into which fixed elements of the DHIS2 user interface have been
translated.
3. Select a Database language. 
You can select a language into which implementation-supplied items have been translated in
the database, for example data element names or organisation unit level names.
4. In the Available roles section, double-click the user roles you want to assign to the user.
451
Manage users, user roles and user groups Create a user
Select Data capture and maintenance organisation units.
5. 
The data capture and maintenance organisation units control for which organisation units the
user can do data entry. You must assign at least one data capture and maintenance
organisation unit to each user.
Users will have access to all sub-organisation units of the assigned organisation units. For
example, if you've assigned a user to a district which has several facilities contained in the
district, the user would have access to the district's data, as well as all of the facilities contained
within the district.
6. (Optional) Select Data output and analysis organisation units.
The data output and analysis organisation units controls for which organisation units the user
can view aggregated data in the analytics apps, for example the Pivot Table and GIS apps.
You can assign any number of data output and analysis organisation units to a user.
Users will have access to all sub-organisation units of the assigned organisation units. You
shouldn't select the descendants of an organisation unit which you have already selected. For
example, if you've assigned the user to a district, you shouldn't select the facilities within that
district.
Note
Assigning data output and analysis organisation units organisation units is
optional. If you don't specify any organisation unit, the user will have access
to the full organisation unit hierarchy for viewing aggregated data. As with
the data capture organisation units, you should not select descendant
organisation units of a unit which you have already selected.
452
Manage users, user roles and user groups Edit user
In several places in the analytics apps, you can select "user organisation
unit" for the organisation unit dimension. This mechanism will first attempt
to use the data view organisation units linked to the current user. If not
found, it will use the data capture and maintenance organisation units. If the
user has been assigned to multiple organisation units, the use of "user
organisation unit" may result in unpredictable behaviour.
1. Click Show more options and an additional three fields will show. (Optional) 
2. In the Search organisation units select the organisation units you want the user to be able to
search in.
3. (Optional) In the Available user groups section, double-click the user groups you want to
assign to the user.
4. (Optional) In the Available dimension restrictions for data analytics section, double-click the
dimensions you want to assign to the user. 
You can restrict the values the user sees in data analytics apps by selecting dimensions that will
restrict the user's view.
Example
Let's say you have defined Implementing Partner as a category option
group set, and you have shared with this user only one or more specific
implementing partners (category option groups). If you want to make sure
that the user does not see totals in analytics that include values from other
groups, assign Implementing Partner to the user.
This insures that any data visible to the user through the analytics apps will
be filtered to select only the Implementing Partner category option group(s)
which are visible to the user.

Decentralize user management
DHIS2 supports a concept for user management referred to as managed users which allows to
explicitly define which users should be allowed to manage or modify which users. To "manage a user"
implies that you can see and modify that user. The basic concept for user management is that you can
459
Manage users, user roles and user groups Example: user management in a health system
see and modify users which you have been granted all of the authorities; in other words you can
modify users which have a subset of your own authorities. The managed users concept gives you
greater control over this.
The managed users concept allows you to define which users should be able to manage which users.
This is configured through user groups and memberships within such groups. A user group can be
configured to be allowed to manage other user groups from the standard add and update user
interface. The effect is that a specific user can manage all users which are members of user groups
which can be managed by a user group that the user is member of. In other words, users can be
managed by all members of user groups which are managing user groups they are member of.
To enable this concept you should grant users the authority to "Add/update users within managed
groups", and not grant access to the standard "Add/update users" authority. An implication of the
managed users concept is that when creating a user with the "Add/update users within managed
groups" only, the user must be made a member of at least one user group that the current user can
manage. If not, the current user would lose access to the user being created immediately. This is
validated by the system.
When granted the "Add/update users within managed groups" authority, the system lets a user add
members to user groups for which she has read-only access to. The purpose of this is to allow for
decentralized user management. You may define a range of user groups where other users may add
or remove members, but not remove or change the name of the group.
Example: user management in a health system
In a health system, users are logically grouped with respect to the task they perform and the position
they occupy.
1. Define which users should have the role as system administrators. They are often part of the
national HIS division and should have full authority in the system.
2. Create roughly one user role for each position.
Examples of common positions are:

About sharing of objects Sharing of objects
About sharing of objects
This chapter discusses the sharing of entities feature in DHIS2.
Sharing of objects
Many objects in DHIS2, like reports, charts, maps and indicators, can be shared. DHIS2 supports
sharing of metadata or sharing of data. Sharing of metadata means making an object, like a report,
available for reading or modification to a group of users or to everyone. Sharing of data means making
the actual data captured available to others, and controlling who can capture that kind of data. For
instance for reports, the sharing dialog can be opened by clicking on the "Sharing settings" button next
to each report in the list. Implementers can use this feature to allow access to certain objects to only
certain user groups. Users can use the feature to decide who they would like to share objects (such as
pivot tables, charts, dashboards, etc) with.
If sharing is supported for a particular class of objects, a dialog will be available called "Sharing
settings", usually available by clicking on the name of the object or in the analytics tools, through an
icon (Share with other people). Once you have accessed the sharing settings for the object you wish
to share, a dialog similar to the one below will be shown.
470
About sharing of objects Sharing of objects
You can share your report with everyone or with a number of user groups. "External access" can be
enabled to allow this resource to be shared with everyone, including users which cannot logon to
DHIS2. This is useful for sharing public resources with external systems. Note, that if objects are
shared externally, then they are visible to anyone who has access to the URL which provides the
resource without any login credentials. Also note that "External access" does not give access to
logged in users—to give them access, you must also allow "Public access".
Next to "Public access" you can choose your public access option under "METADATA": "No access",
"Can view only" or "Can edit and view", and under "DATA": "No access", "Can view data", "Can
capture data". Public access refers to users which are logged into the system. Edit also implies
deleting the report.
To share with a group, simply start typing the name of the group and the "Search for user groups"
input field and select your desired group. Click on the "+" icon next to the input field to share with that
group. For each group you can set an access option, similar to public access.
471
About sharing of objects Metadata sharing and access control
Sharing with a user group implies that all users in that group will get access to the shared object. To
create a user group you can go to the dashboard module and click on "Groups". This will lead you to
the list of groups where you can click "Add new" in the top right corner. Creating user groups is open
for everyone from the dashboard module.
Metadata sharing and access control
The objects which support metadata sharing are indicator, indicator group, indicator group set, data
dictionary, data set, program, standard report, resource, report table, chart, map and user group. Out
of those objects, report table, chart, map and user group are open for everyone to create privately.
Private means that the objects are available only to yourself or potentially to a number of user groups
if you choose to share the object. These objects are referred to as "open" objects and can be created
by all users. The remaining objects require that your user account has the authority to create them.
These objects are referred to as "non-open" objects.
A user can be granted the authority to create publicly accessible objects or privately accessible
objects. In order to create a publicly accessible object (available for viewing or editing by anyone) your
user account must have the authority to do so. As an example, to create a publicly accessible chart,
your user must have the "Create public chart" authority granted. The authority to create private objects
applies only to non-open objects. For example, to allow a user to create indicators which will only be
accessible to that user and not to everyone, the user can be issued with the "Create private indicator"
authority.
Sharing a non-open object with another person and let her edit the object requires that the person's
user account has the authority for updating that type of objects granted. For instance, if you want to let
another person edit your indicator, that person's user account must have the "Update indicator"
authority granted. This does not apply for open objects.
When you create a new object it will automatically become viewable for everyone if your user account
has the authority to create public objects. As an example, if you create a standard report and you have
the "Create public standard report" authority granted, the report will become viewable for everyone. If
you do not have that authority granted the report will be viewable only to yourself. After you have
created an object, you may navigate to the "Sharing settings" dialog and set your desired access
control level.
If you need a user account which is able to view absolutely all objects you can create a user role with
the "ALL" authority and assign a user to that role. If you need to switch between a "complete" view of
objects and a "personal" view of objects it is recommended to create two user accounts, one assigned
with the "ALL" authority and one without.
Metadata sharing applied
The metadata sharing functionality is useful in several scenarios. One use-case is setting up a DHIS2
instance for a global organisation with operations in multiple countries. Typically the organisation has a
set of global data sets, indicators and reports which should apply to all countries, while all countries
will have the need for country-specific data sets, indicators and reports. In this scenario the following
approach could work:
• Set up one user group for global personnel.
• Set up a user group for personnel in each country.
• Create global data sets and reports, make them viewable for everyone and editable for the
global user group only.
• Create country-specific data sets and reports, make them viewable and editable for the country
user group and the global user group only.
472
About sharing of objects Data sharing and access control
This way, the global indicators and reports could be viewed and analysed by everyone, but maintained
by the global user group only. The country-specific data sets, indicators and reports could be viewed
and maintained by the country and global personnel, without being visible or impacting the system for
other countries in the organisation.
A similar approach could work for a scenario with a donor, multiple funding agencies and implementing
partners in a country, where user groups could be set up for each of those entities. That way each
implementing partner could create and share their reports within their organisation without affecting or
allowing access to others. Reports could also be shared with supervisors and funding agencies at the
end of reporting periods.
Another use-case is a country department of health with multiple health programs. Typically there is a
need for having general reports and charts for the department while allowing the health programs to
develop specific reports and charts for internal use. This can be achieved by creating user groups for
each health program. Later, when developing reports and charts, these can be made viewable and
editable to the program user group only. This way the reports will not be visible to other programs and
users. This is beneficial because the reports are kept internal to the program and because the visible
list of reports of other users are kept shorter and more relevant.
Data sharing and access control
The objects which support data sharing are data set, tracked entity type, program and program stage.
The purpose of data sharing is to control which users can capture data, and which users can see the
data captured.
Data sharing for event based programs
Applies to the object types of tracked entity type, program and program stage. When working with
single event programs in event capture, a user will have to possess the "DATA:Can view data" sharing
level to see the program and its data. Without this sharing level, the program and its data will not be
visible to the user. When working with tracker programs in tracker capture, the user will need to have
"DATA:Can view data" to both the tracked entity type and program. In case of a tracker program, the
user will also need "DATA:Can view data" on each program stage individually to be able to see the
data within the program. To capture data the user needs the "DATA:Can capture data" sharing level.
Note
To see and capture data for a program, a data capture user also needs to
report for an organisation unit to where the program has been assigned.

Data sharing for data sets
Applies to the object types of data set and category option . When working in Data Entry app, the user
will need to have "DATA:Can capture data" to both see and capture data in the data set. To save data
for an entry field in Data Set users need:
1. Authority: F_DATAVALUE_ADD ( Can add data value )
2. Data Set is shared with "Data: Can capture data"
3. Data Element is shared with "Metadata: Can View"
4. All Category Options used by selected Data Set are shared with "Data: Can capture data"

Configure the Maps app Context
Configure the Maps app
Context
Setting up the Maps simply means storing coordinates for the organisation units you want to show on
the map in the database. Coordinates are often distributed in proprietary formats and will need to be
converted to a format which DHIS2 understands. ESRI shapefiles are the most common geospatial
vector data format for desktop applications. You might find shapefiles for your country here or in many
other geospatial data repositories on the web. Some amount of work needs to be done in order to use
these coordinates in DHIS2 GIS, namely transforming the data into a suitable format and ensuring the
name which are contained in the geospatial data match exactly with the names of the organization
units which they should be matched to.
Only organisation units with POINT geometry types can be edited through the Maintenance App at this
time. To modify POLYGON geometries, please us the GML import feature.
To edit the POINT coordinates of an organisation unit, open the Maintenance App and navigate to the
Organisation Unit section. Click on the Organisation Unit you would like to view or edit, you can search
or filter the list from on the left-hand side of the screen. Once an organisation unit is selected, you can
edit the Latitude and Longitude values to update the POINT coordinates. If the Organisation Unit has
a POLYGON geometry, the coordinates cannot be edited.
If you are going to add or update coordinates for a large number of units, or if you need to update
polygon geometries, you should use the automatic GML import. The following section explains how to
perform a GML import.
Important
The only co-ordinate reference system supported by DHIS2 is EPSG:4326,
also known as geographic longitude/latitude. Coordinates must be stored
with the longitude (east/west position) proceeding the latitude (north/south
position). If your vector data is in a different CRS than EPSG 4326, you will
need to re-project the data first before importing into DHIS2.
Importing coordinates
Step 1 - Simplify/generalize your geographical data
The boundaries in geographical data files are usually very accurate, too much so for the needs of a
web-based GIS. This usually does not affect the performance when using GIS files on a local system,
but it is usually necessary to optimize the geographical data for the web-based GIS system of DHIS2.
All geographical data needs to be downloaded from the server and rendered in a browser, so if the
data is overly complex, the performance of the DHIS2 GIS will be negatively impacted. This
optimization process can be described as follows:
Coordinates: The number of significant decimal digits (e.g. 23.02937874993774) should be shortened
to fewer digits (e.g. 23.03). Although this will result in some inaccuracies on the map, given the usual
scale at which maps in DHIS2 are produced (> 1:50,000), the loss of precision should not be
noticeable. Normally, no more than four significant digits after the decimal point should be necessary.,
Polygons: In addition to shortening the number of significant digits, the actual number of points should
also be reduced to an optimal level. Finding this optimal level may take a bit of experimentation.
Decreasing the precision of the points as well as the number of points through generalization, will lead
to degradation of the polygon. However, after a bit of experimentation, an optimal level of
generalization can be found, where the accuracy of the polygon is visually acceptable, and the
performance of the GIS is optimal.
476
Configure the Maps app Importing coordinates
For polygons, we need to make the boundary lines less detailed by removing some of the line points.
Make a backup of your shapefiles before you start. One possible method is the use of MapShaper
which is an online tool which can be used to generalize geographical data. To use MapShaper, simply
upload your shapefile to the site. Then, at the centre bottom you see a slider that starts at 0%. It is
usually acceptable to drag it up to about 80%. In the left menu you can check "show original lines" to
compare the result and you may want to give a different simplification method a try. When you are
happy with the result, click "export" in the top right corner. Then check the first of the four options
called "Shapefile - polygons", click "create" and wait for the download buttons to appear. Now,
download the two files to your local computer and overwrite the existing ones. Move on to the next
step with your new simplified shapefile.
Step 2 - Convert the shapefile to GML
The recommended tool for geographical format conversions is called "ogr2ogr". This should be
available for most Linux distributions sudo apt-get install gdal-bin. For Windows, go to 
http://fwtools.maptools.org/and download "FWTools", install it and open up the FWTools command
shell. During the format conversion we also want to ensure that the output has the correct coordinate
projection (called EPSG:4326 with geographic longitude and latitude). For a more detailed reference
of geographic coordinates, please refer to this site. If you have already reprojected the geographic
data to the geographic latitude/longitude (EPSG:4326) system, there is no need to explicitly define the
output coordinate system, assuming that ogr2ogr can determine the input spatial reference system.
Note that most shapefiles are using the EPSG:4326 system. You can determine the spatial reference
system by executing the following command.
ogrinfo -al -so filename.shp
Assuming that the projection is reported to be EPSG:27700 by ogrinfo, we can transform it to
EPSG:4326 by executing the following command.
ogr2ogr -s_srs EPSG:27700 -t_srs EPSG:4326 -f GML filename.gml filename.shp
If the geographic data is already in EPSG:4326, you can simply transform the shapefile to GML by
executing the following command.
ogr2ogr -f GML filename.gml filename.shp
You will find the created GML file in the same folder as the shapefile.
Step 3 - Prepare the GML file
Unfortunately, the GML file is not ready for importation yet. Open it in a robust text editor like Geany
(Linux) or Notepad++ (Windows). GML is an XML based format which means that you will recognize
the regular XML tag hierarchy. In the GML file an organisation unit is represented as a
\<gml:featureMember>. Inside the feature members we usually find a lot of attributes, but we are just
going to import their coordinates.
In order to import geospatial data from the feature members of the GML input, DHIS2 must match
each of them with an organisation unit in its database. The feature member element must, in other
words, contain a reference to its corresponding organisation unit. The reference itself must be one of
three possible DHIS2 identifiers: uid, code or name. The identifier of choice must be provided as a
property for each feature member element. The importer will look for a property with the local name of
either Uid, Code or Name, e.g. "ogr:Name" or "anyPrefix:Code".
477
Configure the Maps app Importing coordinates
If your feature members already contain a property of the identifier you wish to use (such as the name
of an area) you can use search and replace in a text editor to rename these elements to a name
DHIS2 will recognize (see the below table). This is typically a workflow which is applicable when using
the name as the identifier (the source shapefile or even GML will usually contain the name for each
area it defines).
Organisation unit identifiers supported for GML import
Matching priority Identifier Valid spellings Guaranteed unique
1 Uid uid, Uid, UID Yes
2 Code code, Code, CODE No
3 Name name, Name, NAME No
In the case of renaming properties one would usually find a tag named something like
"ogr:DISTRICT_NAME", "ogr:NAME_1" and rename it to "ogr:Name". If using the code or uid
identifiers on the other hand, looking up the correct values in the DHIS2 database and going through
the GML file, adding the properties for each corresponding feature member might be necessary. In any
of the cases it is important to realize that the identifier used must uniquely identify an organisation
unit (e.g. if there are two organisation units in the database of the same name or code, these cannot
be matched properly on either). As uid is the only guaranteed-to-be-unique identifier it is the most
robust choice. However, as matching on name is usually easier (given that the name is already part of
your data), a viable approach to solving uniqueness conflicts can be to match any non-uniquely
named organisation units on a different identifier (uid, preferably) and the rest on their names.
As can be seen in the above table there is a matching priority, meaning is any two or more identifiers
are provided for the same feature member, matching will be performed on the highest priority identifier.
Note also the valid properties which can be used in you GML. The namespace prefix is not important
as only the local name is used.
A common pitfall of performing preparation of the GML files is syntax- or element naming errors.
Therefore please make sure that all properties of the GML file are started and terminated with correctly
corresponding tags. Also make sure the properties follow either of the given valid spellings of the
property name. The identifying properties are supposed to look like e.g. \<ogr:Name>Moyamba
District\</ogr:Name>, \<somePrefix:uid>x7uuia898nJ\</somePrefix:uid> or \<CODE>OU_12345\</
CODE>. Another common error is not making sure the identifier matches exactly, especially when
using the name property. All matches are performed on exact values, meaning that "Moyamba" in a
source GML file would not be matched against "Moyamba District" in the database.
Have a brief look at the identifiers and compare them to the corresponding values in the database. If
they seem to match fairly good, it is about time to do a preview in the import-export module.
Go to Services -> Import-Export, select "Preview", select the GML file and click "Import". Look for new/
updated organisation units. Our intention is to add coordinates to already existing organisation units in
the database, so we want as many updates as possible and 0 new. Those listed as new will be
created as root units and mess up the organisation unit trees in DHIS2. If any listed as new, click the
number and the organisation units in question will appear in the list below. If there are any slight
misspellings compared to the organisation unit names in the database - fix them and do the preview
again. Otherwise, click the "discard all" button below the list and then the "Import all" button above the
list.
If the import process completes successfully, you should now be able to utilize the geographical data
in the DHIS2 GIS. If not, check the log for hints and look for common errors such as:
- Name duplicates in the GML file. The name column in the database is unique and does not accept
two organisation units with the same name.

Types of data and aggregation
In the bigger picture of HIS terminology all data in DHIS2 are usually called aggregated as they are
aggregates (e.g. monthly summaries) of medical records or some kind of service registers reported
from the health facilities. Aggregation inside DHIS2 however, which is the topic here, is concerned with
how the raw data captured in DHIS2 (through data entry or import)are further aggregated over time
(e.g. from monthly to quarterly values) or up the organisational hierarchy (e.g. from facility to district
values).
Terminology
• Raw data refers to data that is registered into the DHIS2 either through data entry or data
import, and has not been manipulated by the DHIS2 aggregation process. All these data are
stored in the table (or Java object if you prefer) called DataValue.
• Aggregated data refers to data that has been aggregated by the DHIS2, meaning it is no longer
raw data, but some kind of aggregate of the raw data.
• Indicator values can also be understood as aggregated data, but these are special in the way
that they are calculated based on user defined formulas (factor * numerator/denominator).
Indicator values are therefore processed data and not raw data, and are located in the
aggregatedindicatorvalue table/object. Indicators are calculated at any level of the
organisational hierarchy and these calculations are then based on the aggregated data values
available at each level. A level attribute in the aggregateddatavalue table refers to the
organisational level of the orgunit the value has been calculated for.
• Period and Period type are used to specify the time dimension of the raw or aggregated values,
and data can be aggregated from one period type to another, e.g. from monthly to quarterly, or
daily to monthly. Each data value has one period and that period has one period type. E.g. data
values for the periods Jan, Feb, and Mar 2009, all of the monthly period type can be
aggregated together to an aggregated data value with the period Q1 2009 and period type
Quarterly.
Basic rules of aggregation
What is added together
Data (raw) can be registered at any organisational level, e.g. at national hospital at level 2, a health
facility at level 5, or at a bigger PHC at level 4. This varies form country to country, but DHIS2 is
flexible in allowing data entry or data import to take place at any level. This means that orgunits that
themselves have children can register data, sometimes the same data elements as their children
units. The basic rule of aggregation in DHIS2 is that all raw data is aggregated together, meaning data
registered at a facility on level 5 is added to the data registered for a PHC at level 4.
It is up to the user/system administrator/designer to make sure that no duplication of data entry is
taking place and that e.g. data entered at level 4 are not about the same services/visits that are
reported by orgunit children at level 5.
NOTE
In some cases you want to have duplication of data in the system, but in a
controlled manner. E.g. when you have two different sources of data for
480
Configure report functionality Types of data and aggregation
population estimates, both level 5 catchment population data and another
population data source for level 4 based on census data (because sum of
level 5 catchments is not always the same as level 4 census data). Then
you can specify using advanced aggregation settings (see further down)
that the system should e.g. not add level 5 population data to the level 4
population data, and that level 3,2,1 population data aggregates are only
based on level 4 data and does not include level 5 data.
How data gets added together
How data is aggregated depends on the dimension of aggregation (see further down).
Along the orgunit level dimension data is always summed up; i.e. simply added together. Note that raw
data is never percentages, and therefore can be summed together. Indicator values that can be
percentages are treated differently (re-calculated at each level, never summed up).
Along the time dimension there are several possibilities, the two most common ways to aggregate are
sum and average. The user can specify for each data element which method to use by setting the
aggregation operator (see further down). Monthly service data are normally summed together over
time, e.g. the number of vaccines given in a year is the sum of the vaccines given for each month of
that year. For population, equipment, staff and other kind of what is often called semi-permanent data
the average method is often the one to use, as, e.g. 'number of nurses' working at a facility in a year
would not be the sum of the two numbers reported in the six-monthly staffing report, but rather the
average of the two numbers. More details further down under 'aggregation operators'.
Dimensions of aggregation
Organisational units and levels
Organisational units are used to represent the 'where' dimension associated with data values. In
DHIS2, organisational units are arranged in a hierarchy, which typically corresponds to the hierarchical
nature of the organisation or country. Organisational unit levels correspond to the distinct levels within
the hierarchy. For instance, a country may be organized into provinces, then districts, then facilities,
and then sub-centres. This organisational hierarchy would have five levels. Within each level, a
number of organisational units would exist. During the aggregation process, data is aggregated from
the lower organisational unit levels to higher levels. Depending on the aggregation operator, data may
be 'summed' or 'averaged' within a given organisational unit level, to derive the aggregate total for all
the organisational units that are contained within a higher level organisational unit level. For instance,
if there are ten districts contained in a province and the aggregation operator for a given data element
has been defined as 'SUM', the aggregate total for the province would be calculated as the sum of the
values of the individual ten districts contained in that province.
Period
Periods are used to represent the 'when' dimension associated with data values. Data can easily be
aggregated from weeks to months, from months to quarters, and from quarters to years. DHIS2 uses
known rules of how these different intervals are contained within other intervals (for instance Quarter 1
2010 is known to contain January 2010, February 2010 an March 2010) in order to aggregate data
from smaller time intervals, e.g. weeks, into longer time intervals, e.g. months.
Data Elements and Categories
The data element dimension specifies 'what' is being recorded by a particular data value. Data
element categories are actually degenerated dimensions of the data element dimension, and are used
481
Configure report functionality Types of data and aggregation
to disaggregate the data element dimension into finer categories. Data element categories, such as
'Age' and 'Gender', are used to record a particular data element, typically for different population
groups. These categories can then be used to calculate the overall total for the category and the total
of all categories.
Aggregation operators, methods for aggregation
Sum
The 'sum' operator simply calculates the sum of all data values that are contained within a particular
aggregation matrix. For instance, if data is recorded on a monthly basis at the district level and is
aggregated to provincial quarterly totals, all data contained in all districts for a given province and all
weeks for the given quarter will be added together to obtain the aggregate total.
Average
When the average aggregation operator is selected, the unweighted average of all data values within
a given aggregation matrix are calculated.
It is important to understand how DHIS2 treats null values in the context of the average operator. It is
fairly common for some organisational units not to submit data for certain data elements. In the
context of the average operator, the average results from the number of data elements that are
actually present (therefore NOT NULL) within a given aggregation matrix. If there are 12 districts within
a given province, but only 10 of these have submitted data, the average aggregate will result from
these ten values that are actually present in the database, and will not take into account the missing
values.
Advanced aggregation settings (aggregation levels)
Aggregation levels
The normal rule of the system is to aggregate all raw data together when moving up the organisational
hierarchy, and the system assumes that data entry is not being duplicated by entering the same
services provided to the same clients at both facility level and also entering an 'aggregated' (sum of all
facilities) number at a higher level. This is to more easily facilitate aggregation when the same services
are provided but to different clients/catchment populations at facilities on level 5 and a PHC (the
parent of the same facilities) at level 4. In this way a facility at level 5 and a PHC at level 4 can share
the same data elements and simply add together their numbers to provide the total of services
provided in the geographical area.
Sometimes such an aggregation is not desired, simply because it would mean duplicating data about
the same population. This is the case when you have two different sources of data for two different
orgunit levels. E.g. catchment population for facilities can come from a different source than district
populations and therefore the sum of the facility catchment populations do not match the district
population provided by e.g. census data. If this is the case we would actually want duplicated data in
the system so that each level can have as accurate numbers as possible, but then we do NOT want to
aggregate these data sources together.
In the Data Element section you can edit data elements and for each of them specify how aggregation
is done for each level. In the case described above we need to tell the system NOT to include facility
data on population in any of the aggregations above that level, as the level above, in this case the
districts have registered their population directly as raw data. The district population data should then
be used at all levels above and including the district level, while facility level should use its own data.
482
Configure report functionality Resource tables
How to edit data element aggregation
This is controlled through something called aggregation levels and at the end of the edit data element
screen there is a tick-box called Aggregation Levels. If you tick that one you will see a list of
aggregation levels, available and selected. Default is to have no aggregation levels defined, then all
raw data in the hierarchy will be added together. To specify the rule described above, and given a
hierarchy of Country, Province, District, Facility: select Facility and District as your aggregation levels.
Basically you select where you have data. Selecting Facility means that Facilities will use data from
facilities (given since this is the lowest level). Selecting District means that the District level raw data
will be used when aggregating data for District level (hence no aggregation will take place at that
level), and the facility data will not be part of the aggregated District values. When aggregating data at
Province level the District level raw data will be used since this is the highest available aggregation
level selected. Also for Country level aggregates the District raw data will be used. Just to repeat, if we
had not specified that District level was an aggregation level, then the facility data and district data
would have been added together and caused duplicate (double) population data for districts and all
levels above.
Resource tables
Resource tables provide additional information about the dimensions of the data in a format that is well
suited for external tools to combine with the data value table. By joining the data value table with these
resource tables one can easily aggregate along the data element category dimension or data element/
indicator/organisation unit groups dimensions. E.g. by tagging all the data values with the category
option male or female and provide this in a separate column 'gender' one can get subtotals of male
and female based on data values that are collected for category option combinations like (male, \<5)
and (male,>5). See the Pivot Tables section for more examples of how these can be used.
orgunitstructure is another important table in the database that helps to provide the hierarchy of
orgunits together with the data. By joining the orgunitstructure table with the data values table you can
get rows of data values with the full hierarchy, e.g. on the form: OU1, OU2, OU3, OU4, DataElement,
Period, Value (Sierra Leone, Bo, Badija, Ngelehun CHC, BCG \<1, Jan-10, 32) This format makes it
much easier for e.g. pivot tables or other OLAP tools to aggregate data up the hierarchy.
Report tables
Report tables are defined, cross-tabulated reports which can be used as the basis of further reports,
such as Excel Pivot Tables or simply downloaded as an Excel sheet. Report tables are intended to
provide a specific view of data which is required, such as "Monthly National ANC Indicators". This
report table might provide all ANC indicators for a country, aggregated by month for the entire country.
This data could of course be retrieved from the main datamart, but report tables generally perform
faster and present well defined views of data to users.
How to create report tables
To create a new report table, go to the Report tables section of the Reports module (Reports -> Report
Table). Above the list of standard reports, use the "Add report table" or "Add Dataelement Dimension
Table" buttons. A regular report table can be used to hold data on data elements, indicators or dataset
completeness, while Dataelement dimension tables are used to include data element categories in
report tables. Creating the tables are done in the same way, however, the only exception being when
choosing data.
To create a report table, you start by making some general choices for the table, the most important of
which is the crosstab dimension. Then, you choose which data elements, indicators, datasets or data
element dimensions you want to include. Finally you select which organisation units and time periods
to use in the report table. Each of these steps are described in detail below.
483
Configure report functionality General options
General options
Cross tab dimensions
You can cross-tab one or more of the following dimensions: data element/indicator, orgunit, and
period, which means that columns will be created based on the values of the dimensions chosen, e.g.
if indicators is selected you will get column names in the table reflecting the names of the selected
indicators.
For example, if you cross-tab on indicators and periods, the column headers will say "\<indicator title>
\<period>". The organisation units will be listed as rows. See screenshot for clarification:
If you cross-tab on indicators and organisation units, the column headers of the table will say
"\<indicator title> \<organisation unit>". Now the periods will be listed as rows. See screenshot for
clarification:
Note that the options made here regarding crosstab dimensions may have consequences for what
options are available when using the report table as a data source later, for example for standard
reports.
Sort order
Affects the rightmost column in the table, allows you to choose to sort it low to high or high to low.
Top limit

Indicators/Data elements
Here you select the data elements/indicators that you want to include in the report. Use the group filter
to more easily find what you are looking for and double click on the items you want to include, or use
the buttons to add/remove elements. You can have both data elements and indicators in the same

Data sets
Here you select the data sets that you want to include in the report. Including a data set will give you
data on the data completeness of the given set, not data on its data elements. Double click on the
items you want to include, or use the buttons.
Selecting report parameters
There are two ways to select both what organisation units to include in a report, and what time periods
should be included: relative, or fixed. Fixed organisation units and/or periods means that you select
the units/periods to include in the report table when you create the report table. Using relative periods,
you can select the time and/or units as parameters when the report table is populated, for example
when running a standard report or creating a chart. A combination is also possible, for example to add
some organisation units in the report permanently while letting the users choose additional. Report
parameters is discussed below. In general, using fixed organisation units and/or time periods are an
unnecessary restriction.
485
Configure report functionality Selecting report parameters
Fixed Organisation Units
To add fixed organisation units, click "Toggle fixed organisation units". A panel will appear where you
can choose orgunits to always include in the report. If you leave it blank, the users select orgunits
when running the report through the use of report parameters. Use the drop down menu to filter
organisation units by level, double click or use the buttons to add/remove.
Fixed Periods
To add fixed periods, click "Toggle fixed organisation units". A panel will appear where you can choose
periods to always include in the report. If you leave it blank, the users select periods when running the
report through the use of report parameters. Use the drop down menu to choose period type (week,
month, etc), the Prev and Next button to choose year, and double click or use the buttons to add/
remove.
Relative periods
Instead of using fixed/static periods like 'Jan-2010' or 'Q1-2010', more generic periods can be used to
create reusable report tables, e.g. for monthly reports the period 'Reporting month' will simply pick the
current reporting month selected by the user when running the report. Note that all relative periods are
relative to a "reporting month". The reporting month is either selected by the users, otherwise the
current month is used. Here is a description of the possible relative periods:
• Reporting month:
Use this for monthly reports. The month selected in the reporting month parameter will be used
in the report.
• Months/Quarters this year:
This will provide one value per month or quarter in the year. This is well suited for standard
monthly or quarterly reports where all month/quarters need to be listed. Periods that still have
no data will be empty, but will always keep the same column name.
• This year:
This is the cumulative so far in the year, aggregating the periods from the beginning of the year
up to and including the selected reporting month.
• Months/Quarters last year:
This will provide one value per month or quarter last year, relative to the reporting month. This is
well suited for standard monthly or quarterly reports where all month/quarters need to be listed.
Periods that still have no data will be empty, but will always keep the same column name.
• Last year:
This is the cumulative last year, relative to the reporting month, aggregating all the periods from
last year.
Example - relative periods
Let's say we have chosen three indicators: A, B and C, and we have also chosen to use the relative
periods 'Reporting month' and 'This year' when we created the report table. If the reporting month
(selected automatically or by the user) is for example May 2010, the report table will calculate the
values for the three selected indicators for May 2010 (= the 'Reporting month') and the accumulated
values for the three selected indicators so far in 2010 (= so far 'This year').
486
Configure report functionality Data element dimension tables
Thus, we will end up with six values for each of the organisation units: "Indicator A May 2010",
"Indicator B May 2010" "Indicator C May 2010", "Indicator A so far in 2010", "Indicator B so far in 2010"
and "Indicator C so far in 2010".
Report parameters
Report parameters make the reports more generic and reusable over time and for different
organisation units. These parameters will pop up when generating the report table or running a report
based on the report table. The users will select what they want to see in the report. There are four
possible report parameters, and you can select none, all, or any combination.
• Reporting month:
This decides which month will be used when the system is choosing the relative periods. If the
box it not checked, the user will not be asked for the reporting month when the report is
generated - the current month will then be used.
• Grand parent organisation unit:
Select the grand parent of all the orgunit children and grand children you want listed in the
report. E.g. a selected region will trigger the use of the region itself, all its district, and all their
sub-districts.
• Parent organisation unit:
Select the parent of all the orgunit children you want listed in the report. E.g. a selected district
will trigger the use of the district itself and all its children/sub-districts.
• Organisation unit:
This triggers the use of this orgunit in the report. No children are listed.
Example - report parameters
Continuing with the example on relative periods just above, let's say that in addition to 'Reporting
month', we have chosen 'Parent organisation unit' as a report parameter when we created the report
table. When we're running the report table, we will be asked to select an organisation unit. Now, let's
say we choose "Region R" as the organisation unit. "Region R" has the children "District X" and
"District Y".
When the report is run, the system will aggregate data for both "District X" and "District Y". The data
will be aggregated from the lowest level where they have been collected. The values for the districts
will be aggregated further to give an aggregated value for "Region R".
Thus, the report table will generate the six values presented in the previous example, for "District X",
"District Y" and "Region R".
Data element dimension tables
These tables enable the use of data element categories in report tables. There are two differences
from regular report tables. The first is that it is not possible to select crosstab dimensions, as the
columns will always be the disaggregations from the category combinations. The other is the actual
choice of data. Only one category combination can be added per report, and only data elements from
the same category combo can be selected.
Subtotals and the total will also be included in the table, e.g. a gender (male, female) + EPI age(\<1,
>1) category combo would give the following columns: male+\<1, male+>1, Female+\<1, female+>1,
male, female,\<1, >1, total.

Selecting data
Use the drop down menu to choose category combinations. The data elements using this category

Report table - best practices
To make the report tables reusable over time and across orgunits they can have parameters. Four
types of parameters are allowed; orgunit, parent orgunit (for listing of orgunits in one area), grand
parent orgunit and reporting month. As a side note it can be mentioned that we are looking into
expanding this to include reporting quarter and year, or to make that period parameter more generic
with regard to period type somehow. The ability to use period as a parameter makes the report table
reusable over time and as such fits nicely with report needs such as monthly, quarterly or annual
reports. When a report is run by the user in DHIS2, the user must specify the values for the report
tables that are linked to the report. First the report table is re-generated (deleted and re-created with
updated data), and then the report is run (in the background, in Jasper report engine).
Report tables can consist of values related to data elements, indicators or data completeness, which is
related to completeness of reporting across orgunits for a given month. Completeness reports will be
covered in a separate section.
There are three dimensions in a report table that identify the data; indicators or data elements,
orgunits and periods. For each of these dimensions the user can select which metadata values to
include in the report. The user must select one or more data elements or indicators to appear in the
report. The orgunit selection can be substituted with a parameter, either one specific orgunit or an
orgunit parent (making itself and all its children appear in the report). If one or more orgunits are
selected and no orgunit parameter is used, then the report is static with regard to which orgunits to
include, which in most cases is an unnecessary restriction to a report.
Using relative periods
The period selection is more advanced as it can in addition to specific periods like Jan-09, Q1-08,
2007 also contain what is called relative periods. As report usually is run routinely over time a specific
period like Jan-09 is not very useful in a report. Instead, if you want to design a monthly report, you
should use the relative period called Reporting Month. Then you must also include Reporting Month
as one of your report parameters to let the system know what exactly is the Reporting Month on the
time of report generation. There are many other relative periods available, and they all relate to the
report parameter Reporting Month. E.g. the relative period called So far this year refers to the
488
Configure report functionality Report table outcome
accumulative value for the year incl. the Reporting Month. If you want a trend report with multiple
periods in stead of one aggregated period, you can select e.g. 'Months this year', which would give
you values for each month so far in the year. You can do a similar report with quarters. The idea is to
support as many generic report types as possible using relative periods, so if you have other report
needs, please suggest new relative periods on the mailing list, and they might be added to the report
table options.
Cross-tabbing dimensions
Cross tabbing is a very powerful functionality in report design, as the typical DHIS2 data table with
references to period, data element/indicator and orgunit makes more advanced report design very
difficult, as you cannot put e.g. specific indicators, periods or orgunits on specific columns. E.g. by
cross-tabbing on the indicator dimension in an indicator report table you will get the indicator names
on the column headers in your report, in addition to a column referencing orgunit, and another column
referencing period. With such a table design you could drag and drop indicator names to specific
columns or chart positions in the iReport software. Similarly you can cross tab on orgunits or periods
to make their names specifically available to report design. E.g. by cross-tabbing on periods and
selecting the two relative periods 'Reporting month' and 'This year', you can design reports with both
the last month and the accumulative annual value for given month as they will be available as column
headers in your report table. It is also possible to combine two dimensions in cross-tabbing, e.g.
period and indicator, which makes it possible to e.g. look at three selected indicators for two specific
relative periods. This would e.g. make it possible to make a table or chart based report with BCG,
DPT3 and Measles coverage, both for the last month and the accumulative coverage so far in the
year.
All in all, by combining the functionality of cross tabbing, relative periods and report table parameters
you should have a tool to support most report scenarios. If not, we would be very happy to receive
suggestions to further improvements to report tables. As already mentioned, we have started to look at
more fine-grained parameters for the period dimension as the 'Reporting month' does not cover
enough, or at least is not intuitive enough, when it comes to e.g. quarterly reports.
Report table outcome
When the report table is run, the system will calculate values for specified indicators/data elements/
data sets, orgunits and periods. The data will be presented in DHIS2 in a table layout. The column
headers will correspond to the cross-tab dimension you have selected. An example report table
showing ANC coverage for a district in The Gambia, is shown below. Here the indicator and the
periods are cross-tabbed, as can be seen from the column headers.

Standard reports
What is a standard report?
A standard report is a manually designed report that presents data in a manually specified layout.
Standard reports can be based either on report tables or SQL queries. Both approaches are described
in the following sections. The main advantage of using report tables is that of simplicity - no special
development skills are required. In cases where you have special requirements or need to utilize
additional parts of the DHIS2 database you might want to use a SQL based standard report. In any
case you will be able to utilize report parameters in order to create dynamic reports. The following
guide will use the report table approach, while the SQL approach is covered towards the end.
Designing Standard reports in iReport
Jasper iReport Designer is a tool for creating reports that can be used as Standard Reports in DHIS2.
The tool allows for the creation of standard report templates that can easily be exported from DHIS2
with up to date data. The process of creating reports involves four major steps:
1. A report table must be created in DHIS2 with the indicators/data elements/datasets to be used
in the report.
2. You have to run the report table and download the design file (Click the "Download as JRXML"
button).
3. Open the downloaded .jrxml file using the free software Jasper iReport Designer to edit the
layout of the report.
4. The edited report can then be uploaded to DHIS2 to be used as a standard report.
490
Configure report functionality Designing Standard reports in iReport
If you want to preview your report during the design in iReport, you actually have to upload your file to
DHIS2 to see how it looks.
These four steps will be describe in detail in the coming sections. In general, when you are making
standard reports you should have a clear idea of how it should look before you even make the report
table, as how the report table is designed has implications for how the report can be formatted in
iReport. For example, what crosstab dimensions are selected in the report table has consequences for
what crosstabs are available for the standard report, and it has consequences for what types of charts
you can make.
Download and open the design file
NOTE
If you have not created a report table yet, you have to do so. See section
"How to create report tables" to do so.*
Locate your desired report table and run it by clicking the green circle with a white arrow inside. When
the report is shown, click the "Download as JRXML" button to download the design file. Then open
that file in the Jasper iReport Designer software.
Editing the report
You are now ready to edit the layout of the report. The main iReport window consists of a "Report
Inspector" to the left, the report document in the middle, a "Palette" area on the upper right hand side
and a "Properties" area on the lower right hand side. The "Report Inspector" are used for selecting and
examining the various properties of the report, and when selecting an item in the inspector, the
"Properties" panel changes to display properties relating to the selection. The "Palette" is used for
adding various elements, e.g. text boxes, images and charts to the document.
NOTE

Configure report functionality Designing Standard reports in iReport
If you cannot see the Palette or Properties sidebar, you can enable them
from the menu item called "Window" on the menu bar.
The iReport document is divided into seven main bands, divided by layout separators (the blue lines).
These lines are used to decide how big each of the areas should be on the report.
The areas all have different purposes:
• Title - area for the title of the report
• Page header - area for the page header
• Column header - area for column headers (for the table)
• Detail 1 - area where the actual report data will be placed
• Column footer - area to make footer of the table
• Page footer - area for the page footer
• Summary - elements in this area will be placed at the end of the report
By default you will see that only the Title, Column Header and the Detail 1 bands have data. For most
reports this is OK. The Title band is suitable for a title and e.g. a chart. Data fields entered into the
Detail 1 area will be iterated over to create a table. For example, if a field called "dataelementname" is
placed in the Detail 1 band, all data elements in the report table will be listed here. We'll come back to
data fields management just a little below.
The unused bands in the report are contracted to add more space for your report data. You can
however increase/decrease the band height as you like. There are two ways to do that. The first way is
simply to drag the blue band-line as shown below.
The other way to adjust the band height is to select a band in the "Report Inspector", and then adjust
the "Band height" value in the "Detail 1 - properties" area in the lower right corner.
As the fields are already present on the report, you probably don't want to do anything than just fix the
layout and drag fields around. You can also resize the fields by dragging the side, top or bottom lines.
If you want to change the text in the column headers, you simply double click the field and change the
text.
492
Configure report functionality Designing Standard reports in iReport
To add the a field to the table, we simply drag it to the Detail 1 band from the "Report Inspector". The
column header will be added automatically.
By double clicking the box, the text can be edited. The format of the text, such as size, font and
alignment, can be adjusted with the tools above the document.
NOTE
Fields starting with "$F" present values that are retrieved from the database
every time the report is run. The values here will vary, so do not change
these fields unless you want a static value here!
Text
There are two types of text in iReport: «Text labels» and «Text fields» (data fields). They work in
different ways, and should be used for different purposes. The main point is that text fields are just
placeholders that will be filled with the correct text from the report table when the report is run, while
text labels will stay the way they are when the report is run.
Static text
Static text are text plain text labels that can be edited normally. There are two ways to edit text labels:
• By double clicking in the text box
• By using the Static text properties in the Properties panel
Text fields
Text fields are formulas that will be filled from the report table when the report is run. Unlike static text,
these can not be edited in a normal way. However, they can be manipulated in various ways to ensure
that the desired output will be produced. There are three ways to edit the text fields:
• By right clicking on the text box and selecting Edit expression
• By double clicking the text field (not recommended, as this will not bring up the expression
editor)
• By using the Text field properties in the Properties panel
493
Configure report functionality Designing Standard reports in iReport
Text fields can represent either numbers or text, so that they can be used both for showing for
example names of district or for numeric values. It is therefore important the Expression class, seen in
the Text field properties matches the Text field expression. For the default text fields in the .jrxml file
downloaded from DHIS2 this is not a problem, but it is important when making new text fields. The two
most important Expression classes are java.lang.Double for numbers and java.lang.String for text.
Example
For example, let us say you have a quarterly report where you would like to add a new column with
the yearly total. You therefore add a new Static text field to the column header band, and a Text field to
the details band in. By default, new Text fields are set to java.lang.String (text). However, the yearly
total column will be filled with numbers. We therefore have to change the Expression class for the new
text field to java.lang.Double:
When we edit the text field expression, we see the Expression editor window with all the available
columns from the report table. We can see here that each of these are marked with what type they are
- text or number. What we need to make sure of is therefore that the expression class we choose for
the text field matches the actual expression.
494
Configure report functionality Filtering the table rows
Filtering the table rows
In the default table exported from DHIS2, there are some rows that it might be better to leave out of
the table, and some that it would be preferable to have at the end. For example, when making a table
based on a report table with the «parent organisation unit» parameter, the default table might have a
row with the national level somewhere in between all the regions. In iReport, this can be changed so
that the «parent organisation unit» appears at the bottom of the table. This involves two steps that will
be explained below. Note that this will not work where there is only one organisation units, and it is
therefore most useful when using the «parent organisation unit» or «grand parent organisation unit»
parameters in the report table.
Hiding the «parameter organisation unit» from the table
We exclude the "parameter organisation unit" from the table by using a property in the Details band
called "Print when expression". To set a Print when expression, start by selecting the Detail band in
the Report inspector, then edit the Print when expression in the properties panel.
495
Configure report functionality Filtering the table rows
The Expression editor window should now appear. What we must do is to create an expression that
checks if the row being generated is the row with the organisation unit given as a parameter. The
report table contains a column that we can use for this called organisation_unit_is_parent. To exclude
the row with the parameter organisation unit, double click on organisation_unit_is_parent in the list to
copy it to the expression area, then add .equals("No") at the end so that the code is:
$F{organisation_unit_is_parent}.equals("No")
This tells the report engine to only print table rows where the organisation unit is not the parent
organisation unit.
496
Configure report functionality Filtering the table rows
Putting the "param organisation unit" at the bottom of the table
Instead of removing the "param organisation unit" from the table entirely, it is also possible to put it at
the bottom (or top) of the table. This is done by using the sort functionality explained in the next
section, and choosing to sort first by "organisation_unit_is_parent". Other sorting options can be
added in addition to this, for example to make a list where the param organisation unit is at the bottom
of the table, with the other organisation units listed alphabetically above it.
Hiding other rows
Using the expression editor it is also possible to exclude other rows from the table, in addition to the
parent organisation unit as was explained above. In Ghana, for example, all regions have a «fake
district» which is the name of the region in square brackets. This can also be excluded from the table
using the Print when expression that was introduced above. To to this, follow the instructions above to
bring up the Expression editor window. Then, we use Java expressions to test whether or not the row
should be hidden.
Example - removing rows with organisation units starting with [
Example - removing rows with organisation units starting with [
($F{organisationunitname}.charAt( 0 ) != '[')
This makes the report skip any rows where the first character of the organisation unit name is [.
It is also possible to combine several of these expressions. To do this we put the expressions in a
parenthesis with the two characters && in between. For example, to make a table that leaves both
organisation units whose name starts with [ and the parent organisation unit, we can use the following
expression:
497
Configure report functionality Sorting
($F{organisationunitname}.charAt( 0 ) != '[')&&$F{organisation_unit_is_parent}.equals("No")
Sorting
Often you will be making reports where the first column is organisation unit names. However, it can be
a problem that the list of organisation units are not sorted alphabetically. This can be fixed in iReport
through a few simple steps.
In the report inspector, right click on the name of the report (by default this is dpt) and select Edit
query.
A Report query window will appear. Click on the Sort options button.
498
Configure report functionality Sorting
A Sorting window as show below will appear. Here, we can add our sorting options. Click the Add field
button. Another small window will show up, with a drop down menu where you can choose Sort by
organisationunitname to have the table sorted alphabetically by name.
499
Configure report functionality Changing indicator/data element names
Click OK - Close - OK to close the three windows. The table should now be sorted.
Changing indicator/data element names
By default, the reports from DHIS2 uses the short names for indicators and data elements in reports
and charts. In some cases these are not always very meaningful for third parties, but with some work
they can be given custom names through iReport. This is useful for example if you are making a report
with indicators as rows and periods as column, or for charts with indicators.
To change the names of an indicator or data element, we have to edit its «expression» or formula, for
example by right clicking the text box and choosing Edit expression to bring up the Expression editor.
Next, we have to insert some Java code. In the following example, we will be replacing the shortname
of three indicators with their proper names. The code searches for the shortname, and then replaces it
with a proper name.
500
Configure report functionality Adding horizontal totals
($F{indicatorname}.equals("Bed Util All")) ? "Bed Utilisation - All Wards"
:
($F{indicatorname}.equals("Bed Util Mat")) ? "Bed Utilisation - Maternity"
:
($F{indicatorname}.equals("Bed Util Ped")) ? "Bed Utilisation - Paediatric"
:
$F{indicatorname}
From this, we can see a pattern that is reusable for more general cases.
• For each indicator or data element we want to change the name for, we need one line
• Each line is separated by a colon :
• We finish the expression with a «regular» line
Each line has the same format, where the red text is the shortname, the blue text is what we want to
insert instead.
The same expressions can be used for example when having indicator names along the category axis
of a chart.
Adding horizontal totals
By using the expression editor, it is possible to add a column to the table with totals for each row. In
the following example, we will make a table with three months as columns as well as a column with
the totals for the three months.
501
Configure report functionality Groups of tables
We start by dragging a text label into the table header and changing its text to "Total", and dragging a
text field into the details row.
As was discussed in the section on "Text field", we have to change the properties of the new text field
so that it can display numbers. To do this, change the "Expressions Class" in the properties panel to
"java.lang.Double".
Right click the text field and choose "Edit Expression". This will bring up the "Expressions editor". As
the expression, we want to sum up all the columns. In this case we have three value expressions we
want to sum up: "September", "October 2010", "November 2010". The name of these fields will vary
depending on the crosstab dimension you have chosen in the report table. In our case, the expression
we make is
$f{September}+$f{October 2010}+$f{November 2010}
Each row of the table will have a totals column to the right.
Groups of tables
There are cases when it can be useful to have several tables in one report. This can be done using
Report groups. Using this functionality, one can for example create a report one table for each
indicator, or one table of each organisation unit. In the following, we will go through the steps needed
to make a report with three indicators, each represented in one table. It is important that the report
table does not crosstab on indicators when we want to make groups of tables based on indicators.
In our example, the .jrxml file downloaded from DHIS2 will by default have one column for organisation
unit and on for indicators (assuming we have chosen periods as the only crosstab dimension). We
start by removing the indicator column, since this in not needed in our case, and realign the other
fields to fit the report.
Next, we create out Report group. Go to the report inspector, right click on the report name (dpt is the
default) and choose Add Report Group.
502
Configure report functionality Groups of tables
A window will appear, with a report group wizard. Select a name for the group, in this case we choose
«Indicator». In the drop down menu, we can select what columns in the report table we want the
groups to be based on. So, if we wanted one table for each organisation unit, we would choose
organisation unit name as the report object to group according to. However, since we are grouping by
indicators in this example, we choose indicatorname. Then click next.
The next step is to select whether or not we want a separate Group header and Group footer band for
each report group. In this case, we choose to include both. Click Finish, and the group bands should
appear in the report.
503
Configure report functionality Groups of tables
If you upload and run the report, it will now create one table for each indicator. However, it will not look
very good as there will be no header row over each table - only one header at the top of each page.
Also, there is no indication as to which table is showing which indicator. In the following, we will fix this.
Instead of having the title row in the column header, we can instead move it to the Group header. This
will make the heading show up above each individual table. Furthermore, we can add a heading to
each table with the name of the indicator.
Move the column headers from the Column header band to the Indicator group header band.
Next, add a text field to the Indicator group heading band, and edit it’s expression to display the
indicator name.
504
Configure report functionality Groups of tables
The report should now have three tables, one for each indicator. Each table will have a heading with
the name of the indicator, and also a table header row.
Sorting and grouping
When using grouping, some precautions must be taken with regards to sorting. Notably, when adding
sorting parameters, whatever parameter is used as basis for the grouping must come first. Thus if you
are grouping the report by indicator, and want sort the organisation units alphabetically, you have to
choose to sort first by indicator, then by organisation unit name as shown below. For instructions on
how to add sorting, see the sorting section above.
505
Configure report functionality Charts
Charts
By default, a 3D bar chart is included in the .jrxml file that is downloaded from DHIS 2. This is set up
so that only data from the «parameter organisation unit» (often the parent or grand parent) is used.
Usually, this is a good solution. Since it is the default, we will start by looking at bar charts, before
looking at line charts.
Bar charts
Bar charts are the default chart type in DHIS2. In this section, we will look at how to make a bar charts
like the one above, comparing the value of one indicator in several districts. To edit the default chart in
iReport, right click on it and choose Chart data.
506
Configure report functionality Bar charts
A window will appear. By default, the Filter expression is filled in so that only data for the parent
organisation unit will be displayed. If for some reason you do not want this, simply delete the text in
the text box. In this case we do NOT want the filter, as we are making a chart showing a comparison
across districts. To continue, click the details tab.
507
Configure report functionality Bar charts
Under details, you see the list of series for the chart. By default, one series is created per crosstab
column. In this case, we are looking at data for one indicator for the whole of 2010, for a number of
districts. The indicator is along the crosstab dimension.
508
Configure report functionality Bar charts
To make changes to a series, select it and click modify. Another window will appear where there are
four areas that can be edit. The three first are required, but it is sufficient to add an empty quote («») in
one of the first two.
509
Configure report functionality Bar charts
The first box is a text field where the name of the series can be inserted or edited. This is the field that
will be used to fill the text in the legend box (shown below).
However, if you want to have the name of each bar along the x-axis of the chart instead of using the
legend, this can be done by adding whatever text you want to present in the Category expression field,
or by inserting an expression to have it filled automatically when the report is run. In this case, we
want to have one bar for each organisation unit. We therefore edit the category expression by clicking
on the button to the right.
510
Configure report functionality Bar charts
As the expression, we chose organisationunitname, as shown below.
When we are finished, the series editor should look like below. Click OK, then Close to close the Chart
Details window.
511
Configure report functionality Bar charts
If you add a good description in the Category expression area, you can leave out the legend box. This
is done in the Report properties panel of iReport, where you can also edit many other details of the
chart.
We can also add a title to the chart, for example the name of the indicator. This is also done in the
Chart properties panel, under Title expression.
512
Configure report functionality Line charts
The Expression editor window will appear, where you can enter the title. Note that the title must be in
quotes, as shown below.
The chart is now ready.
Line charts
Line charts can be useful in many circumstances. However, to make line charts the report data (report
table) must be suited for it. Thus if you want to make a line chart, it is important that the report table
does not have periods in the crosstab dimension. Examples where this is useful is if you are making a
report for a single organisation unit with one or more indicators, or if you are making a report with one
indicator and one or more organisation units.
Below, we will go though the steps needed to make a report with a line chart showing the development
of three indicators over one year, for one organisation unit. We start by making a report table with the
choices shown below:
513
Configure report functionality Line charts
When we open the resulting .jrxml-file in iReport, the default line chart is included. Since we want to
make a line chart, we delete this chart and drag a new chart element into the report from the Palette
panel.
514
Configure report functionality Line charts
As soon as we drag the Chart element into the report, a window will appear. We choose the Line
chart, as shown below.
A chart wizard will appear. Click next in the first step, then Finish in the next - we will add the data
later.
515
Configure report functionality Line charts
516
Configure report functionality Line charts
Next, adjust the size and position of the chart in your report. Then, we will add one data series for
each of our three indicators. Right-click on the chart and choose Chart data. If you are making a chart
with one indicator and several organisation units, you probably want to make a filter expression so that
only data from the parameter/parent organisation unit is used in the chart. To do this, add this line to
the Filter expression area:
$F{organisation_unit_is_parent}.equals("Yes")
In our example, we only have on organisation unit, so this is not necessary. Next, click the details tab
to see a list of the series in the chart. For now, this list is empty, but we will add one series for each of
our three indicators. To add a series, click the Add button.
517
Configure report functionality Line charts
518
Configure report functionality Line charts
In the window that appears, enter the name of the first of the indicators in the Series expression
window. Remember to put the name in quotes. In the category expression (along the x-axis) we want
the months, so we use the button next to the field to open the Expression editor and add periodname.
519
Configure report functionality Line charts
In the value expression, we add the actual data values for our first indicator. Use the Expression editor
again to do this. When we are finished, the window should look like the one below, only with different
names according to the indicator.
520
Configure report functionality Line charts
You can then Click OK to close the window. Follow the same steps to add a series for the other
indicators.
521
Configure report functionality Line charts
Close the window, and the data for the line chart should be ready. However, some additional
adjustments might be needed - most of these can be found in the Line chart properties panel. For
example, when making a month by month chart as we have in example, there is often not enough
space for the month names along the category axis. This can be fixed by rotating the labels by for
example -40 degrees, by using the property Category Axis Tick Label Rotation.
Many other options are available to give the chart the desired look.
522
Configure report functionality Adding the Report to DHIS2
Adding the Report to DHIS2
We can now switch to DHIS2 and import our report. Go to the Report Module in DHIS2, and select
"Standard Report". In the "Standard Report" screen, click "Add new", or edit an existing one.
In the following screen, there are several actions we need to take. First, enter a name for the new
"Standard Report". Second, for design, click "Choose File" and find the .jrxml-file you have edited in
iReport. Then we select the report table that we used as a basis for the report in iReport. Click add,
and it should move to the "Selected report tables" area. Finally, click save.
523
Configure report functionality Some final guidelines
The report is now available as a "Standard Report" in DHIS2:
Some final guidelines
• Use the same version of iReport and DHIS2's version of Jasper reports. See the About page in
DHIS2 for the Jasper version in use.
• Use report tables with cross tab dimensions as your data source for your report designs. This
will make it a lot easier to design reports where you need to put specific indicators, periods, or
orgunits on columns.
• Learn from others, there are many DHIS2 report designs for Jasper on launchpad, see http://
bazaar.launchpad.net/~DHIS2-devs-core/DHIS2/trunk/files/head:/resources/
524
Configure report functionality Designing SQL based standard reports
Designing SQL based standard reports
A standard report might be based on SQL queries. This is useful when you need to access multiple
tables in the DHIS2 database and do custom selects and joins.
- This step is optional, but handy when you need to debug your reports and when you have direct
access to the database you want to use. Click on the "report datasources" button, "New", "Database
JDBC connection" and click "next". In this window you can give you connection a name and select the
JDBC driver. PostgreSQL and MySQL should come included in your iReport. Then enter the JDBC
connection URL, username and password. The last three refers to your database and can be retrieved
from your DHIS2 configuration file (hibernate.properties). Click "save". You have now connected
iReport to your database.
- Go to standard reports and click "add new", then "get report template". Open this template in iReport.
This template contains a series of report parameters which can be used to create dynamic SQL
statements. These parameters will be substituted based on the report parameters which we will later
select and include in the standard report. The parameters are:
• periods - string of comma-separated identifiers of the relative periods
• period_name - name of the reporting period
• organisationunits - identifier of the selected organisation units
• organisationunit_name - name of the reporting organisation unit
• organisationunit_level - level of the reporting organisation unit
• organisationunit_level_column - name of the corresponding column in the _orgunitstructure
resource table
These parameters can be included in SQL statements using the $P\!{periods} syntax, where
"periods" represents the parameter.
- To create a SQL query in iReport, click on the "report query" button. Write or paste your query into
the textarea. An example SQL query using parameters which will create a report displaying raw data
values at the fourth level in the org unit hierarchy is:
    select district.name as district, chiefdom.name as chiefdom, ou.name as facility,
    bcg.value as bcg, yellowfever.value as yellowfever, measles.value as  measles
    from organisationunit ou
    left outer join _orgunitstructure ous
      on (ou.organisationunitid=ous.organisationunitid)
    left outer join organisationunit district
      on (ous.idlevel2=district.organisationunitid)
    left outer join organisationunit chiefdom
      on (ous.idlevel3=chiefdom.organisationunitid)
    left outer join (
      select sourceid, sum(cast(value as double precision)) as value
      from datavalue
      where dataelementid=359706
      and periodid=$P!{periods}
      group by sourceid) as bcg on bcg.sourceid=ou.organisationunitid
    left outer join (
      select sourceid, sum(cast(value as double precision)) as value
      from datavalue
      where dataelementid=35
      and periodid=$P!{periods}
      group by sourceid) as yellowfever on yellowfever.sourceid=ou.organisationunitid
    where ous.level=4
525
Configure report functionality Designing HTML based standard reports
    and ous.$P!{organisationunit_level_column}=$P!{organisationunits}
    order by district.name, chiefdom.name, ou.name;
Notice how all parameters are used in the query, along with SQL joins of resource tables in the DHIS2
database.
- Finally, back in the add new report screen, we click on "Use JDBC data source". This enables you to
select any relative period and report parameters for your report. Relative periods are relative to today's
date. Report parameters will cause a prompt during report creation and makes it possible to
dynamically select organisation units and periods to use for your report during runtime. For the
example above, we must select "reporting month" under relative periods and both "reporting month"
and "organisation unit" under report parameters. Click save. This will redirect you to the list of reports,
where you can click the green "create" icon next to your report to render it.
Designing HTML based standard reports
A standard report can be designed using purely HTML and JavaScript. This requires a little bit of
development experience in the mentioned subjects. The benefit of HTML based standard reports is
that it allows for maximum flexibility. Using HTML you can design exactly the report you want,
positioning tables, logos and values on the page according to your design needs. You can write and
save your standard report design in a regular text file. To upload your HTML based standard report to
DHIS2 do the following:
• Navigate to standard reports and click "Add new".
• Give the report a name.
• Select "HTML report" as type.
• If you want to you can download a report template by clicking on "Get HTML report template".
• Select desired relative periods - these will be available in JavaScript in your report.
• Select report parameters - these will be available in JavaScript in your report.
The report template, which you can download after selecting report type, is a useful starting point for
developing HTML based standard reports. It gives you the basic structure and suggests how you can
use JavaScript and CSS in the report. JavaScript and CSS can easily be included using standard
script and style tags.
If you selected relative periods when creating the standard report you can access these in JavaScript
like this:
var periods = dhis2.report.periods; // An array with period identifiers
var period = periods[0];
If you selected the organisation unit report parameter when creating the standard report you can
access the selected organisation unit in JavaScript like this:
var orgUnit = dhis2.report.organisationUnit; // An object
var id = orgUnit.id;
var name = orgUnit.name;
var code = orgUnit.code;
526
Configure report functionality Designing HTML based standard reports
When designing these reports you can utilize the analytics Web API resource in order to retrieve
aggregated data in JavaScript. Have a look in the Web API chapter in this guide for a closer
description. As a complete, minimal example you can retrieve analytics data after the report has been
loaded and use that data to set the inner text of an HTML element like this:
<script type="text/javascript">
$( document ).ready( function() {
    $.get( "../api/analytics?
dimension=dx:FnYCr2EAzWS;eTDtyyaSA7f&dimension=pe:THIS_YEAR&filter=ou:ImspTQPwCqd", 
function( json ) {
        $( "#bcg" ).html( json.rows[0][2] );
        $( "#fic" ).html( json.rows[1][2] );
    } );
} );
</script>
<div>BGG coverage: <span id="bcg"></span></div>
<div>FIC coverage: <span id="fic"></span></div>
A few other tips: To include graphics you can convert an image to SVG and embed that SVG content
directly in the report - DHIS2 is based on HTML 5 where SVG tags are valid markup. To include charts
and maps in your report you can use the charts and maps resources in the Web API. You can use the
full capability of the Web API from JavaScript in your report - it may be useful to read through the Web
API chapter to get an overview of all available resources.

Feedback recipients Defines a user group where the members will
receive all messages sent via the feedback function
in the Dashboard app.
This will typically be members of the super user team
who are able to support and answer questions
coming from end-users.
Max offline organisation unit levels Defines how many levels in the organisation unit
hierarchy will be available offline in the organisation
unit tree widget.
Under normal circumstances you can leave this on
the lowest level, which is default is the default
setting.
It can be useful to set it to a higher level to reduce
initial load time in cases where you have a large
number of organisation units, typically more than 30
000.
Data analysis std dev factor Sets the number of standard deviations used in the
outlier analysis performed on the captured data in
the Data Entry app.
The default value is 2. A high value will catch less
outlier values than a low value.
Phone number area code The area code for the area in which your deployment
is located.
Used for sending and receiving SMS. Typically, this
is a country code.
+260 (country code for Zambia)

System settings Analytics settings
Setting Description
Cacheability Sets whether analytics data responses should be
served with public or private visibility.
Private: Any node or server between the DHIS2
server and the end user which has the ability to
cache can NOT cache the web page. This is useful if
the page served can or do contain sensitive
information. This means that each time you want a
web page, either you get a new page from the
DHIS2 server, or the DHIS2 server caches the page.
No other server than the DHIS2 server are allowed
to cache the page.
Public: Any node or server between the DHIS2
server and the end user which has the ability to
cache can cache the web page. This relives the
traffic to the DHIS2 server and potentially speeds up
the subsequent page loading speed.
Analytics cache mode Support two different modes:
Progressive: this relates to the new progressive
caching feature for analytics. When enabled, it
OVERRIDES the global caching strategy for
analytics requests. This mode will trigger HTTP and
data layer caching for all analytics requests. When
enabling this mode, the caching factor is
MANDATORY.
Fixed: the requests will be cached based on the
period of time defined in cache strategy.
Caching factor Select a value for the caching factor. This field is only
available when the analytics cache mode has been
set to progressive.
It shows a list of integers where each integer
represents an absolute caching factor. This integer
will be used internally to calculate the final expiration
time for each analytics request. Higher the caching
factor, for longer the request will be cached.
531
System settings Server settings
Setting Description
Max number of years to hide unapproved data in Sets whether and for how long back in time analytics
analytics should respect the approval level of the data.
Typically, data which is several years old would be
considered to be approved by default. In order to
speed up analytics requests, you can choose to
ignore the actual approval level of historical data.
Never check approval: no data will be hidden,
irrespective of its data approval status.
Check approval for all data: approval status will
always be checked.
Other options, for example Last 3 years: approval
status will be checked for data which is newer than 3
years old; older data will not be checked.
Threshold for analytics data caching Sets whether to enable caching data older than the
specified number of years only.
This allows for returning the most recent data directly
with no caching, while serving cached version of
older data for performance concerns.
Respect category option start and end date in This setting controls whether analytics should filter
analytics table export data which is associated with a category option with
a start and end date, but which is not associated with
a period within the category options interval of
validity.
Put analytics in maintenance mode Places the analytics and web API of DHIS2 in
maintenance mode. This means that "503 Service
Unavailable" will be returned for all requests. 
This is useful when you need to perform
maintenance on the server, for example rebuilding
indexes while the server is running in production, in
order to reduce load and more efficiently carry out
the maintenance.

System settings OAuth2 clients
Setting Description
Enable versioning for metadata sync Defines whether to create versions of metadata
when you synchronize metadata between central
and local instances.
Don't sync metadata if DHIS versions differ The metadata schema changes between versions of
DHIS2 which could make different metadata versions
incompatible.
When enabled, this option will not allow metadata
synchronization to occur if the central and local
instance(s) have different DHIS2 versions. This apply
to metadata synchronization done both via the user
interface and the API.
The only time it might be valuable to disable this
option is when synchronizing basic entities, for
example data elements, that have not changed
across DHIS2 versions.
Best effort A type of metadata version which decides how the
importer on local instance(s) will handle the
metadata version.
Best effort means that if the metadata import
encounters missing references (for example missing
data elements on a data element group import) it
ignores the errors and continues the import.
Atomic A type of metadata version which decides how the
importer on local instance(s) will handle the
metadata version.
Atomic means all or nothing - the metadata import
will fail if any of the references do not exist.

Data Administration Data integrity
Data Administration
The data administration module provides a range of functions to ensure that the data stored in the
DHIS2 database is integral and that the database performance is optimised. These functions should
be executed on a regular basis by a data administrator to ensure that the quality of the data stored is
optimal.
Data integrity
DHIS2 can perform a wide range of data integrity checks on the data contained in the database.
Identifying and correcting data integrity issues is extremely important for ensuring that the data used
for analysis purposes is valid. Each of the data integrity checks that are performed by the system will
be described, along with general procedures that can be performed to resolve these issues.
Data elements without data set
Each data element must be assigned to a data set. Values for data elements will not be able to be
entered into the system if a data element is not assigned to a data set. Choose Maintenance-
>Datasets->Edit from the main menu and then add the "orphaned" data element to the appropriate
data set.
Data elements without groups
Some Data Elements have been allocated to several Data Element Groups. This is currently not
allowed, because it will result in duplication of linked data records in the analytics record sets that
provide aggregated data. Go to Maintenance -> Data Element Groups to review each Data Element
identified and remove the incorrect Group allocations.
Data elements violating exclusive group sets
Some data elements have been allocated to several data element groups that are members of the
same data element group set. All group sets in DHIS2 are defined as exclusive, which means that a
data element can only be allocated to one data element group within that group set. Go to
Maintenance -> Data elements and indicators ->Data element groups to review each data element
identified in the integrity check. Either remove the data element from all groups except the one that it
should be allocated to, or see if one of the groups should be placed in a different group set.
Data elements in data set but not in form or sections
Data elements have been assigned to a data set, but have not been assigned to any sections of the
data set forms. All data sets which use section forms, should generally have all data elements in the
data set assigned to exactly one section of the dataset.
Data elements assigned to data sets with different period types
Data elements should not be assigned to two separate data sets whose period types differ. The
recommended approach would be to create two separate data elements (for instance a monthly and
yearly data element) and assign these to respective datasets.
Data sets not assigned to organisation units
All data sets should be assigned to at least one organisation unit.
Sections with invalid category combinations
Data sets which use section forms should only have a single category combination within each
section. This violation could result from assigning a data element to a section, but then changing the
category combination of this data element at a later point in time.
540
Data Administration Indicators with identical formulas
Indicators with identical formulas
Although this rule will not affect data quality, it generally does not make sense to have two indicators
with the exact same definition. Review the identified indicators and their formulas and delete or modify
any indicator that appears to be the duplicate.
Indicators without groups
All data elements and indicators must be assigned to at least one group, so these Indicators need to
be allocated to their correct Data Element and Indicator Group. From the main menu, go to Data
elements/Indicators -> Indicator Groups, and allocate each of the `Orphaned` indicators to its correct
group.
Invalid indicator numerators
Violations of this rule may be caused by an incorrect reference to a deleted or modified data element.
Review the indicator and make corrections to the numerator definition.
Invalid indicator denominators
Violations of this rule may be caused by an incorrect reference to a deleted or modified data element.
Review the indicator and make corrections to the denominator definition.
Indicators violating exclusive group sets
Some indicators have been allocated to several indicator groups that are members of the same
indicator group set. All group sets in DHIS2 are defined as exclusive, which means that an indicator
can only be allocated to one indicator group within that group set. Go to Maintenance -> Data
elements and indicators ->Indicator groups to review each indicator identified in the integrity check.
Either remove the indicator from all groups except the one that it should be allocated to, or see if one
of the groups should be placed in a different group set.
Duplicate periods
If periods have been imported from external applications, it may be possible that some periods will be
duplicated. If you have any periods which appear to be duplicated here, you will need to resolve these
directly in the DHIS2 database. All data which has been assigned to the duplicated period, should be
moved to the correct period, and the duplicate period should be removed.
Organisation units with cyclic references
Organisation units cannot be both parent and children of each other, directly nor indirectly. If this
situation occurs, you will need to resolve the cyclic reference directly in the DHIS2 database in the
"organisation unit" table, by reassigning the "parentid" field of the organisation units.
Orphaned organisation units
All organisation units must exist within the organisation unit hierarchy. Go to Organisation- units
>Hierarchy Operations and move the offending organisation unit into the proper position in the
hierarchy.
541
Data Administration Organisation units without groups
Organisation units without groups
All organisation units must be allocated to at least one group. The problem might either be that you
have not defined any compulsory OrgUnit Group Set at all, or that there are violations of the
compulsory rule for some OrgUnits . NOTE: If you have defined no compulsory OrgUnit Group Sets,
then you must first define them by going to Organisation units->Organisation unit group sets and
define at least one compulsory Group Set (the group set 'Type' are nearly universally relevant). If you
have the relevant group sets, go to Maintenance -> OrgUnit Groups to review each OrgUnit identified
and add the relevant Group allocation.
Organisation units violating compulsory group sets
These organisation units have not been assigned to the any organisation unit group within one of the 
compulsory organisation unit group sets. When a group set is defined as compulsory, it means that an
organisation unit must be allocated to at least one organisation unit group within that group set. For
instance, all organisation units must belong to one of the groups in the 'Type' group set. It might
belong to the `Hospital` or the `Clinic` or any other 'type' group - but it must belong to exactly one of
them. Go to Organisation units->Organisation unit groups to review each organisation unit identified in
the integrity check. Allocate all organisation units to exactly one compulsory group.
Organisation units violating exclusive group sets
Some organisation units have been allocated to several organisation unit groups that are members of
the same organisation unit group set. All group sets in DHIS2 are defined as exclusive, which means
that an organisation unit can only be allocated to one organisation unit group within that Group Set.
For instance, one organisation unit cannot normally belong to the both the 'Hospital' and 'Clinic' groups
, but rather to only to one of them. Go to Organisation unit->Organisation unit groups to review each
organisation unit identified in the integrity check. Remove the organisation units from all groups except
the one that it should be allocated to.
Organisation unit groups without group sets
The organisation unit groups listed here have not been allocated to a group set. Go to Maintenance-
>Organisation unit->Organisation unit group sets and allocate the Organisation unit group to the
appropriate group set.
Validation rules without groups
All validation rules must be assigned to a group. Go to Maintenance app > Validation rule group and
assign the offending validation rule to a group.
Invalid validation rule left side expressions
An error exists in the left-side validation rule definition. Go to Maintenance app > Validation rule and
click Edit on the offending rule. Click Left side and make the required corrections.
Invalid validation rule right side expressions
An error exists in the right-side validation rule definition. Go to Maintenance app > Validation rule
and click Edit on the offending rule. Click Right side and make the required corrections.

Maintenance
Data maintenance functions in the Data Administration app
543
Data Administration Maintenance
Function Description
Clear analytics tables Completely empties the analytics tables. These
tables are used to generate aggregate data for the
pivot tables, GIS and reports.
Remove zero data values Removes zero data values from the database.
Values registered for data elements with aggregation
operator average is not removed, as such values will
be significant when aggregating the data, contrary to
values registered for data elements with aggregation
operator sum.
Reducing the number of data values will improve
system performance.
Permanently remove soft deleted data values When a data value is deleted in DHIS2, the system
will mark the corresponding database row as
deleted, and not actually delete the row.
Running this maintenance function will physically
remove these data value rows from the database.
Prune periods Removes all periods which have no registered data
values. Reducing the number of periods will improve
system performance.
Remove expired invitations Will delete users which represent user account
invitations that now have gone past their expiry date.
Drop SQL views DHIS2 lets you set up and manage SQL views as
system objects with corresponding database SQL
views.
Running this maintenance function will drop
underlying SQL views for all system views. Use the 
Create SQL views function to recreate these SQL
views.
Create SQL views Recreates all SQL views in the database.
Update category option combinations Rebuilds the category option combinations. This may
be required after altering the category options which
belong to a given category.
Update organisation unit paths The organisation unit table in the DHIS2 database
has a column "path" which contains a concatenated
string of all ancestors in the hierarchy for each
organisation unit.
Running this maintenance function will update and
ensure that these values are in sync with the current
organisation unit hierarchy. This column is managed
by DHIS2, but a manual update might be useful
when doing data loading directly in the database.
Clear application cache Clears the system cache.
544
Data Administration Resource tables
Function Description
Reload apps Manually reloads and detects installed DHIS2 apps.
The installed apps are also detected when the
system starts and when installing or uninstall apps.
Resource tables
Resource tables are supporting tables that are used during analysis of data. One would typically join
the contents of these tables with the data value table when doing queries from third-party applications
like Microsoft Excel. They are also used extensively by the analysis modules of DHIS2. Regeneration
of the resource tables should only be done once all data integrity issues are resolved. The resource
tables are also generated automatically, every time the analytics process is run by the system.
• Organisation unit structure (_orgunitstructure)
This table should be regenerated any time there have been any changes made to the
organisational unit hierarchy. This table provides information about the organisation unit
hierarchy. It has one row for each organisation unit, one column for each organisation unit level
and the organisation unit identifiers for all parents in the lineage as values.
• Data element group set structure (_dataelementgroupsetstructure)
This table provides information about which data elements are members of which data element
group sets. The table has one row for each data element, one column for each data element
group set and the names of the data element group as values.
• Indicator group set structure (_indicatorgroupsetstructure)
This table provides information about which indicators are members of which indicator group
sets. The table has one row for each indicator, one column for each indicator group set and the
names of the indicator group as values.
• Organisation unit group set structure (_organisationunitgroupsetstructure)
This table provides information about which organisation units are members of which
organisation unit group sets. The table has one row for each organisation unit, one column for
each organisation unit group set and the names of the organisation unit groups as values.
• Category structure (_categorystructure)
This table provides information about which data elements are members of which categories.
The table has one row for each data element, one column for each category and the names of
the category options as values.
• Data element category option combo name (_categoryoptioncomboname)
This table should be regenerated any time there have been changes made to the category
combination names. It contains readable names for the various combinations of categories.
• Data element structure (_dataelementstructure)
This table provides information about all data elements and which period type (frequency) they
capture data at. The period type is determined through the data set membership and hence
relies on data elements to be member of data sets with similar period types to have a defined
behaviour.
• Period structure (_dataperiodstructure)
545
Data Administration Analytics tables management
This table provides information about all periods and which period type they are associated
with. For each period type with lower frequency than itself, it contains information about which
period it will fall within.
• Data element category option combinations (_dataelementcategoryoptioncombo)
This table provides a mapping between data elements and all possible category option
combinations.
Analytics tables management
DHIS2 generates database tables which the system then uses as basis for various analytics functions.
These tables are also valuable if you write advanced SQL reports. In the Data Administration app,
you can execute the tables generation immediately. If you want to schedule them to be executed at
regular intervals, this can be done in the Scheduler app. This means that you can refresh recent
analytics on demand and see updated pivot tables without waiting for all of the past years data to re-
process.
Note
You can also generate the tables through the web API. This task is typically
performed by a system administrator.
1. Open the Data Administration app and click Analytics Tables.
2. Select the parts of the analytics process you want to skip:
◦ Skip generation of resource tables
◦ Skip generation of aggregate data and completeness data
◦ Skip generation of event data
◦ Skip generation of enrollment data
3. Select Number of last years of data to include.
4. Click Start export.
Data statistics
The data statistics module provides an overview of the number of objects stored in the DHIS2
database.
546
Data Administration Lock exceptions
The total number of each type of object is presented in a series of tables with summary statistics of
each object.
Lock exceptions
Lock exceptions provide fine-grained control over exemption from a locked data set. After the expiry of
the data set, data entry will be denied by default, unless an exception has been granted through the
Lock exception interface.
Adding a lock exception
By granting a lock exception, data entry will be enabled even after the expiry period of the data set has
passed.
1. Open the Data Administration app and click Lock Exception.
2. Click Add lock exception at the top of the page
3. Select the desired data set, organisation units and time period (see screenshot below)
4. Click Add lock exception
547
Data Administration Min-Max Value Generation
In the example above, a data lock exception would be created for "Bo" for the "ART monthly summary"
dataset for "February 2014".
Min-Max Value Generation
This administrative function can be used to generate min-max values, which are used as part of the
data quality and validation process for specific organization units and data sets. Simply select the
dataset from the left hand frame, and then select the required organisation units to generate the min-
max values for from the organisational units selector on the right. Press the "Generate" button to
generate or regenerate all min-max values. Press "Remove" to remove all min-max values which are
currently stored in the database.
Cache Statistics
This option is for system administrators only to use. The cache statistics shows the status of the
application level cache. The application level cache refers to the objects and query results that the
application is caching in order to speed up performance. If the database has been modified directly the
application cache needs to be cleared for it to take effect.

About the Usage Analytics app
The Usage Analytics app lets you visualize statistics on how users are working with the Dashboard, 
GIS, Event Visualizer, Data Visualizer and Event Reports apps within DHIS2. With this statistics
you can answers questions such as:
• How many times people have loaded visualizations and dashboards?
• How many favorites have users created?
• How many users that are logging in versus total number of users?
• What are the most viewed favorites?
Create a usage analytics graph
1. Open the Usage Analytics app.
2. Select a Start date and End date.
3. Select an Interval: day, week month or year.
4. Select a Category.
549

There are five analytics categories:
◦ Favorite views: Provides the number of times various types of favorites have been
viewed, such as visualizations and dashboards, over time. This analysis lets you switch
between all types of favorites, the total across all types and the average number of
views.
◦ Favorites: Provides the number of favorites which have been created and stored in the
system over time.
◦ Users: Provides the number of active as well as total number of users over time.
◦ Top favorites: Shows the most viewed favorites in the system by type.
◦ Data values: Provides the number of data values stored in the system over time.

Scheduling Creating a job
Scheduling
The Scheduler is an application for managing background jobs in DHIS2. Background jobs can do a
number of tasks, such as running analytics, synchronizing data and meta data, or sending a push
analysis report. The application provides the ability to create, modify and delete such jobs.
The Scheduler comes bundled with DHIS2 and is accessed through the App Menu.
The start page of the Scheduler app
The start page of the Scheduler app shows an overview of existing jobs. By default, pre-defined
system jobs are hidden. To view these, click Include system jobs in list in the top right corner.
When you create or modify a job, it will be scheduled according to the selected schedule. To run a job
on demand, go to the job list, click the "Actions" button of the job you want to run and click "Run
manually". This action is only available for enabled jobs.
Creating a job
1. Open the Scheduler app and click the "New job" button in the top right corner.
2. Choose a suitable Name for the new job.
3. Select the Job type you want to schedule using the drop-down menu.
4. Select a schedule for the job. Each job type has its own scheduling type, either Cron
scheduling or Delay scheduling.
1. For Cron scheduled job types you can set a schedule using the Spring scheduling
syntax. You can also select a predefined Cron expression by clicking "Choose from
preset times". This schedule will only start a new job run if the previous job run has
finished, to prevent the system from spawning too many jobs.
2. For Delay scheduled jobs you can set a delay in seconds. Unlike the Cron scheduled
jobs, these jobs aren't executed according to a set schedule, but with a specific delay in
between job runs. The delay timer starts when a job ends, starting a new job run when
the delay timer reaches zero. This will continue as long as the job is enabled.
5. If the job type is customizable, a Parameters section will appear below the scheduling settings.
These additional options specify the details of the scheduled job, and will vary depending on the
job type.
6. Press the Save button to confirm the job creation. On successful job creation you will be
redirected to the job overview, where the newly created job will now be listed.
554
Scheduling Editing a job
Creating a new scheduler job
Newly created jobs are enabled by default.
Editing a job
With the proper permissions, you can modify the details of user-created jobs. To quickly enable or
disable a user created job from running, use the switches in the On/off column on the landing page of
the Scheduler app. Note that system jobs are always enabled and cannot be disabled.
Further editing of user jobs:
1. Click the "Actions" button of the job you want to edit and click "Edit" (only user jobs can be
edited).
2. When done editing, press the Save button to persist the changes.
Deleting a job
1. Click the "Actions" button of the job you want to delete and click "Delete" (only user jobs can be
deleted).
2. Confirm by pressing Delete again in the pop-up window.
User jobs can also be deleted from the editing screen.
555
Scheduling Job types
Deleting a scheduler job
Job types
The following section describes the various job types.
Disable Inactive Users
Users that have not been active - not logged in - for a number of months can automatically be
disabled. Select the number of inactive months as the job parameter. All users that have not logged in
for that number of months or longer will be disabled by the job. Disabled users will no longer be able to
log into the system.
The Reminder days before parameter can be set to send a reminder email to those users the specified
number of days before their account is due to expire. If users do not log in further reminder emails are
sent each halving the previous number of days. For example if the number of days is set to 7 the first
email is sent 7 days in advance, the second 3 days and the third and last 1 day in advance. If the
value is not set (blank) no reminder is sent.
Resource table
The resource table job is responsible for generating and updating the resource database tables.
These tables are used by various components in DHIS 2 and is meant to simplify queries against the
database.
Note that when specifying any of the analytics table jobs, resource tables can be part of the process
and it is not necessary to also specify a resource table job.
Analytics table
The analytics tables job is responsible for generating and updating the analytics tables. The analytics
tables are used as basis for data analytics queries in DHIS2. Apps such as dashboard, visualizer and
maps retrieve data from these tables through the DHIS2 analytics API, and they must be updated in
order for analytics data to become available. You can schedule this process to run regularly through
an analytics table job type.
556
Scheduling Continuous analytics table
The analytics table job will by default populate data for all years and data elements. The following
parameters are available:
• Last years: The number of last years to populate analytics tables for. As an example, if you
specify 2 years, the process will update the two last years worth of data, but not update older
data. This parameter is useful to reduce the time the process takes to complete, and is
appropriate if older data has not changed, and when updating the latest data is desired.
• Skip resource tables: Skip resource tables during the analytics table update process. This
reduces the time the process takes to complete, but leads to changes in metadata not being
reflected in the analytics data.
• Skip table types: Skip one or more analytics table types. This reduces the time the process
takes to complete, but leads to those data types not being updated in analytics data.
Continuous analytics table
The analytics tables job is responsible for generating and updating the analytics tables. The analytics
tables are used as basis for data analytics queries in DHIS2. Apps such as dashboard, visualizer and
maps retrieve data from these tables through the DHIS2 analytics API, and they must be updated in
order for analytics data to become available. You can schedule this process to run regularly through
an analytics table job type.
The continuous analytics table job is based on two phases:
• Latest update: Update of the latest data, where latest refers to the data which has been added,
updated or removed since the last time the latest data or the full data was updated. This
process will happen frequently.
• Full update: Update of all data across all years. This process will happen once per day.
The continuous analytics table job will frequently update the latest data. The latest data process
utilizes a special database partition which is used to hold the latest data only. This partition can be
quickly refreshed due to the relatively small amount of data. The partition will grow in size until a full
update is performed. Once per day, all data for all years will be updated. This will clear out the latest
partition.
The analytics table job will by default populate data for all years and data elements. The following
parameters are available:
• Full update hour of day: The hour of the day at which the full update will be done. As an
example, if you specify 1, the full update will be performed at 1 AM.
• Last years: The number of last years to populate analytics tables for. As an example, if you
specify 2 years, the process will update the two last years worth of data, but not update older
data. This parameter is useful to reduce the time the process takes to complete, and is
appropriate if older data has not changed, and when updating the latest data is desired.
• Skip resource tables: Skip resource tables during the analytics table update process. This
reduces the time the process takes to complete, but leads to changes in metadata not being
reflected in the analytics data.
Tracker search optimization
The tracker search optimization job is responsible for generating and updating the trigram indexes for
relevant tracked entity attributes. Trigram indexes improve the performance of searching tracked entity
instances based on specific tracked entity attribute values. The usefulness of trigram indexes depends
on whether the tracked entity attribute is configured as unique or if they are configured as searchable
(when connected to program/tracked entity type). You can configure the job to choose which tracked
entity attributes should be trigram indexed. The job also takes care of deleting any obsolete indexes
that have been created earlier but are no more required due to change in metadata configuration.
557
Scheduling Data synchronization
The following parameters are available:
• Attributes: The list of attributes that needs a trigram index created. For each attribute, a partial
trigram index will be created. As an example, if you specify "firstname" and "lastname" attribute,
the process will create two separate trigram indexes for the corresponding attributes "firstname"
and "lastname". Note that, if the attribute provided in this parameter is not indexable (either
because they are not unique or not searchable), such attributes are simply ignored by the
process and no trigram index will be created for them.
• Skip index deletion: Skip obsolete index deletion during the trigram index process. If set to
true, indexes that are deemed obsolete will not be deleted.
Data synchronization
DHIS2 provides synchronisation of data between remotely distributed instances and a central instance
of DHIS2. This can be useful e.g. when you have deployed multiple stand-alone instances of DHIS2
which are required to submit data values to a central DHIS2 instance. Both tracker data and aggregate
data synchronization is supported.
These are the steps to enable data synchronization:
• Go to Synchronization Settings, enter the remote server URL, username and password. Press
the TAB button to automatically save the new password. Refresh the page and check that the
filled values are still present. Note that the password field will be empty after the refresh, since
this value is encrypted, so you can consider it saved.
• Using the Scheduler app, create a new job using the "Event Programs Data Sync" and/or
"Tracker Programs Data Sync" job type. Make sure it is enabled when you finish. (Note: If the
"Program Data Synchronization" job, available in previous versions, was set up in Scheduler
app before, it was automatically replaced by the two new jobs "Event Programs Data Sync" and
"Tracker Programs Data Sync" with the identical settings. )
Some aspects of the data synchronization feature to be aware of:
• The local DHIS2 instance will store the password of the user account on the remote instance
encrypted in the local database. The remote account is used for authentication when
transferring data. For security purposes make sure you set the encryption.password
configuration parameter in hibernate.properties to a strong password.
• Deploying the remote server on SSL/HTTPS is strongly recommended as the username and
password are sent in clear text using basic authentication and could be intercepted by an
attacker.
• The data synchronization uses the UID property of data elements, category option combos and
organisation units to match the meta-data. Hence the synchronization is dependent on these
three meta-data objects being harmonized on the local and remote instance in order to work
appropriately.
• The first time DHIS2 runs the synchronization job, it will include any data available. The
subsequent synchronization jobs will only include data added and changed since the last
successful job. A synchronization job is considered successful only if all the data was saved
successfully on the remote server (Any data successfully synced will remain on the receiving
instance, regardless if the job eventually fails). Whether the job was successful or not can be
decided from the import summary returned from the central server.
558
Scheduling Metadata Synchronization Scheduling
The initial synchronization job may take a significant amount of time, possibly slowing down
• 
your instance, depending on how much data is being synchronized. It could be a good idea to
configure the job to run when there are few online users, then later change this to your own
preference. If you do not want or need to synchronize all the data, there is a possibility to skip
some of the data being synchronised.
When DHIS2 synchronizes tracker data, it determines the set of data to synchronize based on
the last time it was synchronized. Each of the tracked entity instances and events have their
own records of when they where last successfully synchronized.
• The system will start a synchronization job based on the rules set in the configuration of the job.
If the synchronization job starts while there is no connection to the remote server, it will retry up
to three times before it aborts. The job will run again at a scheduled time.
• The server handles each set of programs separately, which means one set of programs can be
synchronized successfully, while the other fails. The failure or success of one doesn't influence
the other, as the last successful synchronization time is tracked individually for each item as
previously mentioned.
• The attributes of TrackedEntityInstances (TrackedEntityAttribute) and the data elements of
ProgramStages (ProgramStageDataElement) which have an option "Skip synchronization"
turned on will not be synchronized. This feature allows you to decide to not synchronize some
sensitive or not relevant data and to keep them only locally.
• The authority Ignore validation of required fields in Tracker and Event
Capture (F\_IGNORE\_TRACKER\_REQUIRED\_VALUE\_VALIDATION) should be used
when there is a requirement that some mandatory attribute / data element has at the same time
a "Skip synchronization" property turned on. Such a setting will lead to validation failure on the
central server as the given attribute / data element will not be present in the payload.
The validation won't fail for the user with this authority. The authority should be assigned to the
user, on the central server, that will be used for synchronization job.
• In specific cases, the initial synchronization of all the data can be undesirable; for example,
when a database on the local instance is a fresh copy of the database present on the central
instance, or when it is preferred to not synchronize old data in favor of initial synchronization
taking less time.
The syncSkipSyncForDataChangedBefore SettingKey can be used to skip the synchronisation
of all the data (data values, Event and Tracker program data, complete data set registrations)
that were last changed before the specified date. The SettingKey is used in the
synchronization job all the time. Therefore, if you need to synchronize the old data, you should
change the SettingKey.
• Both Tracker Programs and Event Programs synchronization job supports paging in order to
avoid timeouts and to deal with unstable network. Default page size for "Event Programs Data
Sync" job is set to 60. Default page size for "Tracker Programs Data Sync" job is set to 20.
If default values do not fit your purpose, own page size can be specified via parameter in
particular sync job in Scheduler app.
Metadata Synchronization Scheduling
DHIS2 provides a feature for synchronizing meta data from a remote instance to a local instance of
DHIS2. This can be useful when you have deployed multiple stand-alone instances of DHIS2 and you
need to create meta data in all the local instances similar to the central DHIS2 instance.
559
Scheduling Metadata Synchronization Scheduling
These are the steps to enable meta data synchronization:
• Go to Settings > Synchronization, enter the remote server URL, username and password and
click Save.
• Go to Metadata administration > Scheduling. Under Metadata synchronization set strategy to
Enabled, select the time-period and click Start.
Some aspects of the meta data synchronization feature to be aware of:
• The local DHIS2 instance will store the password of the user account of the remote instance in
its database. The remote user account is used for authentication when transferring/downloading
data. For security purposes make sure you set the encryption.password configuration
parameter in hibernate.properties to a strong password.
• Deploying the remote server on SSL/HTTPS is strongly recommended as the username and
password are sent in clear text using basic authentication and could be intercepted by an
attacker.
• Also ensure that the remote user is not having ALL authority, instead simply create a user with
F_METADATA_MANAGE authority so that even if these details are intercepted by a hacker, one
cannot have full control of the remote system.
• The meta data synchronization relies on the underlying import layer. Each meta data version is
an export of meta data between two given timestamps. Each sync of meta data version is an
attempt to import that meta data snapshot into the local instance. The sync of versions is
incremental. The local instance will try to download the meta data versions from the central
instance one after the other. Failure to sync a specific meta data version will not let the sync
proceed to further versions. In case of failures, appropriate changes must be made to meta
data at central to ensure that the error gets resolved. Metadata configuration is critical and the
user should be careful while rolling out the updates to the production. It's always recommended
to have staging environments in place to ensure the sanity of the meta data versions and their
impact thereafter. The local instance will sync the meta data from first version so that harmony
is maintained and local and central instance will work appropriately.
• The system will attempt a synchronization at the scheduled time. If the local or remote server
does not have a working Internet connection at the time, the synchronization will be aborted
and re-attempted after as per the retry count as mentioned in the dhis.conf file.
• You can see the time of last successful synchronization with remote server in the scheduling
screen next to the "Last success" label.
560
Import/Export App Metadata Synchronization Scheduling
Import/Export App
In a primary health system, the HMIS typically involves a distributed application, where the same
application is running in different geographical locations (PHCs,CHCs, hospitals, districts, and state).
Many of these physical locations do not have Internet connectivity, and hence they work off-line. At
some point (normally at the district level), the data needs to be synchronised in order to have a
consolidated database for the a particular geographical region. For this, it is important to be able to
export data from one location (which is working offline, say at the health facility level) and import into
another one (say at the district level). This feature of exporting and importing is thus a crucial function
of a HMIS. This feature also helps us overcome the dependency on the Internet to some degree, as
data updates can be transferred via USB key where there is no connectivity, or through email where
there is limited Internet connectivity. DHIS2 provides robust export-import functionality to fulfil these
needs.
To access the Import/Export app, search in the top header bar for Import/Export. Import/Export app
offers a number of services details for which can be found below.

Tip
It is highly recommend to use the Dry run option to test before importing
data; to make sure you keep control over any changes to your Metadata,
and to check for problems with out-of-sync data elements or organisation
unit names
Note
If an organisation unit e.g. Nduvuibu MCHP had a unknown reference to
an object with ID aaaU6Kr7Gtpidn, it means that the object with ID 
aaaU6Kr7Gtpidn was not present in your imported file, and it was not
found in the existing database.
You can control this using Identifier option, to indicate if you want to allow
objects with such invalid references to be imported or not. If you choose to
import invalid references you will have to correct the reference manually in
DHIS2 later.
Matching Identifiers in DXF2
The DXF2 format currently support matching for two identifiers, the internal DHIS2 identifier (known as
a UID), and also using an external identifier called called a "code". When the importer is trying to
search for references (like the one above), it will first go to the UID field, and then to the code field.
This allows you to import from legacy systems without having a UID for every meta-data object. I.e. if
you are importing facility data from a legacy system, you can leave out the ID field completely (DHIS2
will fill this in for you) and put the legacy system's own identifiers in the code field, this identifier is
required to be unique. This not only works for organisation units, but for all kinds of meta-data,
allowing for easy import from other systems.

Schemes
The various schemes used in many of the import and export pages are also known as identifier
schemes and are used to map metadata objects to other metadata during import, and to render
metadata as part of exports.
Available values
Scheme Description
ID, UID Match on DHIS2 stable Identifier, this is the default id
scheme.
CODE Match on DHIS2 Code, mainly used to exchange
data with an external system.
NAME Match on DHIS2 Name, please note that this uses
what is available as object.name, and not the
translated name. Also note that names are not
always unique, and in that case, they can not be
used.
ATTRIBUTE:ID Match on metadata attribute, this attribute needs to
be assigned to the type you are matching on, and
also that the unique property is set to true. The main
usage of this is also to exchange data with external
systems, it has some advantages over CODE since
multiple attributes can be added, so it can be used to
synchronize with more than one system.
ID scheme
The ID scheme applies to all types of objects, but can be overwritten by more specific object types.
583
Configure metadata synchronizing About data and metadata synchronization
Configure metadata synchronizing
About data and metadata synchronization
You can synchronize data and metadata between different DHIS2 instances. Given two instances in a
central-local deployment strategy, metadata created at the central system can be synchronized with
the local system and the data created at local system can be synchronized with the central system.
This can be useful when you've multiple stand-alone instances of DHIS2 and global metadata needs
to be created at all the local instances.
If metadata creation and update take place at the central system and if the metadata synchronisation
task is enabled, the metadata gets synchronized down to all the local instances which are bound to
the central instance. These local instances will in turn push data values, Event and Tracker program
data and complete data registration sets to the central instance. Enabling or disabling versioning of
metadata synchronization at local instance, will not hinder the metadata synchronization process. This
is because the metadata synchronization interacts with versioning end points of the central instance
and not with end points of the local instance.
Each snapshot of metadata export generated is referred to a metadata version. A new metadata
version contains only the changes between the previous version and the current version, that is it's an
export between two timestamps. All metadata versions are maintained in the DHIS2 database and are
available to all local instances that connect to it. You can schedule each of the local instances to
download new metadata versions. It is recommended to keep the metadata versions' sizes small and
logical.
Warning
Each instance of DHIS2, whether central or local, can create metadata
versions. The local instance is meant to synchronize metadata from a
central system and not create metadata on its own.
If a new metadata version is created on the local instance, this instance
can't receive new metadata versions from the central instance, since the
content of the metadata versions will be out of synchronization.
If you've created metadata versions on a local instance, you must manually
deleted these versions from the database before you can synchronize with
the central instance.
584
Configure metadata synchronizing Workflow
Assume the central and local DHIS2 instances have identical metadata
snapshots until version 10. Then the local instance creates a new snapshot
called version 11. After that, the central instance creates a new snapshot
called version 11. When the local instance attempts to synchronize
metadata, version 11 is not downloaded. However, the content of version
11 on the local instance is not identical to the content of version 11 on the
central instance.
Note
You can also use the Import-Export app to synchronize metadata
manually.
Workflow
1. On the central instance, configure metadata versioning. You should do this once the central
instance contains metadata.
2. Connect local instance(s) to the central instance.
3. On local instance(s), configure automatic synchronization.
Configure metadata versioning on central instance
Note
To synchronize metadata, the user account of the central system must have
the following authority:
F_METADATA_MANAGE
Only users with this authority will then be able to create and download
metadata. This is to ensure security of the central system where the
metadata is created. Instead of giving the credentials of user having ALL
authority to the field instances, you need to create a user having this
specific authority only.
1. On the central instance, open the System Settings app and click Synchronization.
2. Go to the Metadata versioning section and select Enable versioning for metadata sync.
3. (Optional) Select Don't sync metadata if DHIS2 versions differ.
4. Select a type of metadata version: Best effort or Atomic.
◦ Best effort means that if the metadata import encounters missing references (for
example missing data elements on a data element group import) it ignores the errors and
continues the import.
585
Configure metadata synchronizing Connect local instance to central instance
Atomic means all or nothing - the metadata import will fail if any of the references do not
◦ 
exist.
Note
Each metadata entity is associated with a "User" object. If this "User"
reference is missing while importing metadata version of type ATOMIC, the
import will fail at the validation phase itself. This means that the user who
creates metadata also needs to synchronize down to local instances to
successfully import the metadata version of type ATOMIC.
5. Click Create new version. The new version is added to the versioning table.
Connect local instance to central instance
To enable metadata synchronization, you must configure the connection between the local instance
and the central instance.
1. On the local instance, open the System Settings app and click Synchronization.
2. Add the central DHIS2 instance's details to the local instance:
◦ Remote server URL
◦ Remote server user name
◦ Remote server password
3. Go to the Metadata versioning section and select Enable versioning for metadata sync.
4. (Optional) Select Don't sync metadata if DHIS2 versions differ.
The metadata schema changes between versions of DHIS2 which could make different
metadata versions incompatible.
When enabled, this option will not allow metadata synchronization to occur if the central and
local instance(s) have different DHIS2 versions. This apply to metadata synchronization done
both via the user interface and the API.
The only time it might be valuable to disable this option is when synchronizing basic entities, for
example data elements, that have not changed across DHIS2 versions.
5. (Optional) Configure email notifications to notify users about successful or unsuccessful
metadata synchronization:
1. Open the System Settings app and click Email.
2. Enter Host name, Port, User name, Password and Email sender.
3. Click Server and enter a System notifications email address.
This email address will receive notifications about the metadata synchronization status.
Tip
When you receive email notification about a metadata synchronization failure,
check which metadata version that causes the error and resolve it. Then you avoid
future errors when the system downloads new metadata versions.
586
Configure metadata synchronizing Configure automatic metadata synchronization on local instance
Configure automatic metadata synchronization on local instance
Once you have configured automatic metadata synchronization (scheduling) on local instance(s), the
scheduler will run at that specific time and synchronize (download and import) the metadata from the
central instance. No manual intervention is required from the users at the local instance(s).
After the scheduler has completed the metadata synchronization, the local instance will have the
metadata exactly as created on the central system.
Note
Passwords of users are not synchronized. They are nullified for security
reasons. After metadata synchronization, the Admin user must reset these
passwords.
1. On the local instance, open the Data Administration app and click Scheduling.
2. In the Metadata Synchronization section, select Enabled.
3. Select a time period: Daily, Weekly, Monthly or Yearly.
4. Click Start.
Create a new metadata version manually on central or local instance
1. Open the System Settings app and click Synchronization.
2. Go to the Metadata versioning section and select Enable versioning for metadata sync.
3. (Optional) Select Don't sync metadata if DHIS2 versions differ.
587
Configure metadata synchronizing Create a new metadata version manually on central or local instance
Select Best effort or Atomic.
4. 
5. Click Create new version. The new version is added to the versioning table.
When the system is a central instance, you'll see three columns in the versioning table:
Object Description
Master version The latest version in the system.
Version Name of the version. The name is automatically
generated by system.
When The timestamp of the metadata version creation at
the central instance.
Type Type of metadata version.
When system is a local instance, you'll see four columns in the versioning table:
588
Configure metadata Reference information: metadata synchronization configuration
synchronizing parameters
Object Description
Master version The latest version of the central instance.
Note
The master version information is the central
instance's latest version. This is important to look at
the difference between the versions of metadata that
exist at central and at local.
Last sync attempt If the last sync attempt is a failure, this will be
displayed.
Version Name of the version. The name is automatically
generated by system.
When The timestamp of the metadata version creation at
the central instance.
Type Type of metadata version.
Last sync Timestamp of when the last sync happened for this
version in this system.
Reference information: metadata synchronization configuration parameters
The process which performs metadata synchronization is called Metadata Sync Task. This task
performs a series of steps before syncing of metadata:
• Push data (aggregate data and anonymous events data) from local instance to central instance.
589
Configure metadata Reference information: metadata synchronization configuration
synchronizing parameters
Gets the current metadata version of the local instance. Then uses this version information as a
• 
baseline to fetch the list of metadata versions created after the baseline.
• If there are new versions created at central instance, it performs the synchronization of
metadata versions one after the other. A mail will be sent to the configured user (if any) after
each successful synchronization of metadata version at the local instance.
Once the Metadata Sync Task has run at the scheduled time, the task can retry (if any of the steps fail)
based on the configuration of the following parameters defined in dhis.conf file:
Parameter Default value
metadata.sync.retry 3
metadata.sync.retry.time.frequency.mil 30000
lisec
Each retry will be made after the time (in millisecond) as specified. If the steps still fail even after all
the retries, then the scheduler stops its execution and then a mail will be sent to the configured user (if
any). If no values are specified then the default values will be used.
metadata.sync.retry = 5
metadata.sync.retry.time.frequency.millisec = 10000

Mobile DHIS2 Mobile Introduction
Mobile
This chapter covers various mobile technologies including Web, J2ME, SMS Service and SMS
Command.
DHIS2 Mobile Introduction
DHIS2 provides a range of options to allow data entry from mobile devices, including a dedicated
GPRS/3G J2ME client and two versions of DHIS2 which have been optimized specifically for mobile
browsers. Each of these solutions will be described in detail in the following sections. DHIS2 offers
several Android clients, which are described in detail in other sections of this guide.
Collection of data in the field can be technically challenging and expensive. Mobile phone solutions
have the potential to significantly reduce the complexity of deploying a distributed data collection
system. Using a simple Java client installed on a mobile phone or a web browser which works on the
mobile phone, field workers can report directly to the DHIS2 database through their mobile device.
While mobile phone solutions have a great potential, there are complexities with such deployments.
Phones lack processing power and have a small display, they need to be charged, and often such
deployments make the most sense in areas with poor or intermittent network coverage.
Each of the mobile solutions are introduced briefly below, and the discussed in separate sections in
detail:
• DHIS2 Light: A mobile browser optimized data entry module for all devices
This module allows for data entry directly with the browser of the mobile device. A wide range of
devices and mobile browsers are supported including: Opera mini 3 & 4 (basic and advanced) -
Opera mini 4, Nokia S40 mobiles ,Windows Phone 7, Window Mobile 6, Palm Pre, Blackberry
(v5 and v6), Firefox mobile, iOS devices (iPhone) and Android devices. This client does not
have offline-support, and an active GPRS/3G connection is required. It does not require a new
application installation on the phone to support new features, but does require a stable data
connection for use. This solution is described in Mobile browser based data entry
• DHIS2 Smartphone client: A mobile browser optimized data entry module for Smartphone
devices
This module allows for data entry directly with the browser of a Smartphone. Offline data entry
is supported and it does not require any installation of a special client on the phone itself.
• J2ME GPRS/3G client
DHIS-mobile includes two separate J2ME clients supporting GPRS/EDGE/3G as a transport
mechanism. One clients supports facility aggregate reporting and the second client supports
name-based program tracking. These clients are split into separate applications to make
deployment easier. Some health workers may have both applications installed on their phone.
Both of these clients support offline-storage of data and work on J2ME enabled devices (feature
phones). .?>
An active GPRS/3G connection is required in order to send data to the DHIS2 database, but
data can be entered offline and transmitted when a connection is present. This client is intended
primarily for low-end devices which support J2ME applications, although the offline-supports
adds some memory requirements which limits the handset selection. While the solution is
primarily tested on Nokia phones, it also works on several other J2ME capable handsets.
The facility reporting J2ME client is described in the chapter "J2ME GPRS/3G Client"

Mobile Mobile browser based data entry
Mobile browser based data entry
Getting started with mobile browser data entry
This approach is for data-entry on a smart phone with a mobile browser by navigating to the URL of
the DHIS2 instance, for example: the full URL link for demo on dhis2.org http://apps.dhis2.org/dev/
mobile/index.action . And your mobile browser will automatically detect the DHIS2 application where
the server URL is given (e.g.: http://apps.dhis2.org/dev). Here is the login form to access the
application with user-name and password. Click on "Login" to continue or "Reset" to reset:
After logging in, there are the list of functions:
- Aggregate Reporting: Entries for aggregate data with defined/assigned dataset by organisation-
units

Mobile J2ME GPRS/3G Client
Here is the GUI of the desktop version (which require much memory for loading), not
recommended for normal mobile. The example with DHIS2 Demo (from dhis2.org)
J2ME GPRS/3G Client
The DHIS2 GPRS/3G mobile module provides a mechanism for remote clients using mobile phones to
enter data directly into the DHIS2 system. There are two functions of the client, namely:
The solution relies on the mobile phone having a data connection available (i.e. GPRS, Edge, 3G),
over which it communicates with a DHIS2 instance which must be publicly available on the internet, as
any other web server. The client application on the phone downloads the data entry forms to the
phone from the server, and the forms can therefore be updated without installing a new application.
627
Mobile Data connection availability
This is also a crucial feature for community reporting, which relies on regularly downloading activity
plans from the server.
• Facility reporting, for data entry and reporting of regular DHIS2 aggregate data,
• Activity reporting, for supporting individual activity reporting with the Community module.
Data connection availability
Data connection availability can be a problem in many of the contexts where DHIS2 mobile reporting
would otherwise be a good solution for getting data directly into DHIS2. If that is the case for you, you
might want to consider trying the SMS based solution described in a separate document. Keep in mind
that even though a data connection is currently required for communication between the server and
the mobile phone, it is only required when initializing or updating the mobile application and when
sending reports to the server. The phone stores all entered data locally, so it can work fine with only
temporary access to a data connection on a regular basis.
J2ME GPRS 3G facility reporting client
The server side component of the web based solution is included in the general build of DHIS2.
In order to configure the DHIS2 web-based mobile reporting, you should follow the following steps.
• Set the "Available for Mobile Reporting" flag for the data sets you want reported: Under 
Maintenance->DataSet->Edit mark the “Available for Mobile Reporting” check box and save.
• Create a user role for the mobile user. Select Maintenance->Users->User Role->Add new. Add
a user role name and description. Add the desired data sets for the role. The mobile user role
will need to have at least privileges for DHIS2 Web API. Save the user role by clicking "Save".
• Create a user which will be used by the client to login from Maintenance->Users->User ->Add
new. Fill in all of the required details, keeping in mind that the password must be at least 8
digits long, contain one capital letter,and one digit. Assign the desired user role to the user
which was created in the previous step.
Important
Assign the user to exactly one organisation unit. Each mobile reporting client will
need their own user name and password.
Detailed configuration of data sets and reporting forms
Though the previous steps is all that should be needed for testing the solution more detail
configuration of the datasets may be required and are described in the following sections.
The mapping of data sets to form layout on the phone
By default, a data set is mapped to a single form on the phone. If the data set is divided into sections,
each section is displayed as a separate page on the phone. If a data element has more than one
category option combo it will be displayed as a heading with the category combination options
following.
Form design element DHIS2 Metadata Metadata element
Form title Data set Short Name if it exists, otherwise
Name
Page tile Section Section name (or form name if no
sections)
628
Mobile Detailed configuration of data sets and reporting forms
Question Data element Alternative name if it exists,
otherwise Name
Question name if combos Category option combo name
Sorting of forms
By default, data elements will be sorted according to the global sorting assigned in DHIS2. If sections
are used, their section specific sorting order will be used. In some cases, when sections are not used,
a data element might be used in multiple data sets, and conflict in the way it should be sorted in
individual data sets. A work around for this situation is to wrap the whole dataset in one section (note
that this will only work if the data elements have the same category option combo)
Versioning of data sets
To make it possible to compare and update the data sets on the mobile phone with the version on the
server, data sets are automatically versioned when you edit the data set structure. Some changes
which occur on the DHIS2 server, will cause the mobile client to update its forms with a new version.
• Create DataSet
• Edit DataSet
• Create/edit/delete Section in DataSet
• Sort Section Order
• Update DataElement (affect many related DataSets)
• Delete DataElement (affect many related DataSets)
• Edit DataElement Category
• Edit DataElement Category Combo
Language support
Multi-language support is available.
DataSet and DataElement are translated through web-based function. Default language on server is
used on mobile in cases requested language from mobile is not available.

Initialization should be performed before the phones are delivered end-users. Given the large variation
in possible phone configurations, it is impossible to describe the exact steps which are required in
order to enable the client on the phone. However, for most phones, simply copying the DHIS2 Web
Mobile client "JAR" file to the phone with a USB cable or via Bluetooth is sufficient. Of course, GPRS/
3G connectivity must be enabled. Contact your mobile service provider for exact details on the
configuration of the phones and networks.
Once the client has been installed on the phone, an initialization process must occur by providing a
user name, password and server URL.
1. Logging into the server for the first time.
The first time the client logins to the server, or if the client is reinitialized, the username,
password and server URL must be entered.
If the client is unable to login, there could be several possible error messages which you see.
◦ Connection Not Found: The specified server URL is not correct. Check the server
address, ensure that the server is actually reachable, and try again.
◦ Invalid User Name Or Password: the username or password is incorrect
◦ Application not authorized to access restricted APIs : The server can be contacted, but
the user does not have the necessary permissions to access the mobile reporting
module
2. Setting the PIN number: After the initial login process, a PIN number can be entered by the
user. This will make the login process much easier, as the user only has to remember the four
digit pin number, as opposed to typing in the user name and password each time. The PIN
number can be preset if the phone is initialized prior to delivery, or it can be set by the users
themselves if they have been provided with usernames and passwords.
630
Mobile Mobile application setup
After entering the PIN, press (Menu)->Next.
3. Download all forms: After the PIN has been specified, all forms will be downloaded from the
server and stored locally on the phone..
If the user has been configured to report on aggregate datasets, a list of appropriate datasets
will be displayed. If the user is responsible for community based reporting, the list of assigned
activities is displayed.
Notes: If the Health Worker is responsible for both Facility Reporting and Community Reporting,
DHIS2 server will send all forms of both Facility Reporting and Community Reporting to mobile
and on mobile, there will be a screen to choose whether displaying Facility Reporting or
Community Reporting.
Errors:
Logging in (for regular use)
After starting the application, the PIN form is displayed.
• PIN: Enter the four digit number PIN.
• Reinitialize Command: this function will clear all data on mobile and we start from the login
screen with username and password.
• Errors: Invalid PIN: If the user has entered an invalid PIN, they will need to enter the correct
PIN, or reinitialize the application with the correct username and password.
Facility Reporting Module
Entering data
After selecting an aggregate dataset from the "Select report form" window, the user will need to select
an appropriate time period. A list of available time periods is automatically generated.
1. After the user has entered their PIN, they can select from a list of available datasets. Select the
appropriate dataset and press "Next".
631
Mobile Mobile application setup
2. Choosing periods: A list of available periods will be automatically displayed to the user. They
can select the appropriate period from the list.
3. Fill in values: After choosing the period, the form can be displayed in two modes, depending on
the
◦ Form with sections
Each form section is displayed in a single screen with the name of the section in the title
window.
To navigate from screen to screen, push "Next".
◦ Forms without section (Datasets without sections)
632
Mobile Mobile application setup
All fields are displayed on one screen with the title that is the name of DataSet
The user simply fills in each data element with the appropriate value.
4. Save and Complete:
After finishing data entry, the user can choose to save the data locally on the phone or to
upload the data directly to the DHIS2 server.
If the user saves the data form, they can edit the form at a later point in time if they need to.
When selecting a period once again, the period will be marked as "Saved' as seen in the next
screen shot.
633
Mobile Mobile application setup
If the user selects "Complete", and the data entry form is not complete, the user will be asked if
they are certain they wish to submit the form as incomplete. Once the form has been submitted,
a message should be displayed informing the user that the transmission was successful.
Notes
1. Period list:
Periods marked with an asterisk (*) is the period that is completed or saved, depending on the
status of the data entry.
All periods that are not in period list are considered old and will be deleted automatically.
2. Storing values duration
The number of saved forms on mobile are limited only by the effective amount of storage of the
mobile device.
634
Mobile Mobile application setup
Forms are saved for limited period only, depending on the frequency of collection of the
particular dataset.
◦ Daily Forms: 2 months (current and previous month)
◦ Weekly Forms: 4 weeks (current and 3 previous week)
◦ Monthly Forms: 2 months (current and previous month)
◦ Quarterly Forms: 2 quarters (current and previous quarter)
◦ Yearly Forms: 2 years (current and previous year)
3. Completed forms - Uneditable forms
If the form has been completed, the user can view the form on their phone, but they cannot
make any subsequent edits to the form. Each field is greyed out and inactive for editing.
4. Re-Edit completed forms
If the user wishes to edit data which has already been submitted to the server, they can do so
by pressing the "Edit" button. They are allowed to do this assuming that the dataset has not
been locked for the period in question. If they attempt to upload the data, the user will be
informed that the dataset has been locked, and it is not possible to upload the data.
5. Update Forms:
This function is used to synchronize the forms on mobile and on server. The process is
automatically triggered after entering PIN number.
Note: Checking and downloading updated forms process run in background. After finished,
prompt is displayed to ask user whether refresh form list or stay where they are.
6. Multi-Language Support:
This function help user to choose language of mobile's GUI (graphical user interface) and
content's language (Forms).
The forms must be translated on server, otherwise, default language is used.
Default language of first login is English. Change language in Setting menu will affect both
interface and content.
635
Mobile Mobile application setup
Multi-Language Interface: In Setting menu, there are list of supported language (downloaded
from server). Language of GUI is only changed after restart application.

Multi-Language Content (forms): Form's language is change after click "Save". In case there
are many forms, it take several minutes to save setting.
Troubleshooting
• Data has been entered on the phone but does not appear on the server
This usually occurs when users enter data on the phone, but cannot send it to the server. This
may be because of the configuration of the phone, lack of credit on the phone, or lack of
coverage. Usually an error message is displayed as shown below.
Users should be informed that if they see this error, then it means that their data has not been
transmitted.
SMS Command { #mobile_sms_command } 
SMS command feature helps DHIS2 system receiving SMS from users, patients, or even anonymous.
A SMS command is an object containing the configurations for each SMS form: reporting data from
phones or j2me apps, alerting users, registering patient or user, etc.
Set up SMS command
This is where you can create a new SMS command
637
Mobile Set up SMS command
Usually each SMS command has it own property, then the setting up process may be different from
each other. Currently, we have 4 types of SMS command:
638
Mobile Set up SMS command
With KEY_VALUE_PARSER and J2ME_PARSER, the SMS command will have dataset because
those are used for reporting data. If data is reported for a Period which is already approved then SMS
response will be sent back containing information about approval status of the period.
With ALERT_PARSER and UNREGISTERED_PARSER, the SMS command will have user group
because those are used for sending message such as SMS, DHIS2 conversation, email.
There are certain parameters which are common to all SMS Command types. These parameters have
default values configured in the system, if user does provide any value to these parameters then those
default ones will be used. Here is the list of those parameters
Common Parameters
Parameter Type Description
Code Value Separator String To provide custom code value
separator. Default is "="
Field Separator String To provide custom field separator.
Default is "|"
Reply message if no codes are String To provide message if no code is
sent (only the command) found in SMS text input. Default
is "Parameter missing"
Wrong format message String To provide message if command
is not formatted correctly.
Command should be formatted
as per code value separator. This
message will also be sent back if
any mandatory parameter is
missing.
639
Mobile SMS Command Type
Parameter Type Description
No user message String To provide message if sending
phone number is not registered in
DHIS2.
User belong to more than one String Certain SMS command types
OrgUnit message require user ( retrieved from
sending phone number ) to be
associated with only one
organization unit. This message
can be configured to be sent back
in case that requirement is not
fullfilled.
Success Message String To provide message that will be
sent upon successful completion
of the process.
SMS Command Type
The SMS command is basically defined by its parser type. In other word, each SMS command has
one unique parser to parse the plain text SMS, then the result will be used for the purpose of that SMS
command.
SMS Command for Reporting Data
In order to report data for example data set (aggregation), we use SMS commands which have
KEY_VALUE_PARSER (for phone's plain text), or J2ME_PARSER (for j2me apps)
If the command has name "report", and a list of data element with code like above. The format should
be: [command's name] [code][value] [code][value] [code][value]....,the [value] of course might be
changed depends on real data, so you have to prepare an SMS text like this example: report vo2 vn5
a2 b6 z3 x1
In case the command has a separator for instance ".", the SMS text should be:
report vo.2.vn.5.a.2.b.6.z.3.x.1
640
Mobile SMS Command Type
or report vo.2|vn.5|a.2|b.6|z.3|x.1
Moreover in SMS text input, orgUnit can be specified like this org orgUnitCode If no orgUnit is
specified in SMS then user is retrieved first from the sending phoneNumber and then orgUnit from that
user. As far as PeriodType is concerned it should be specified in this format "ddMM" for example 3108,
but in case its not specified then PeriodType will be retrieved from DataSet attached to SMSCommand
With the J2ME_PARSER, you don't need to prepare those SMS text, because the J2ME will do this
job
User can set the custom response message for "Wrong format message", "No User Message", "User
belong to more than one OrgUnit message" and "Success message". If no custom message is being
set, system will use the default message.
SMS Command for Entity Enrollment
TRACKED_ENTITY_REGISTRATION_PARSER can be used to enrol tracked entity into the system.
641
Mobile SMS Command Type
Command name will be followed by tracked entity attributes pertaining to specific program which this
command is associated with. Program selection will be done while creating this command.
Default text pattern ( if field separator and codevalue separator is not provided ) for this parser would
look like this. childProgram fn=xmen|ln=xmen2|age=4
In case field separator is for example "," then text would look like this.childProgram
fn=xmen,ln=xmen2,age=4
Rest of the behavior is same as for other commands. If user does not provide those parameters then
default ones will be used.
SMS Command for Program Stage Data Entry
PROGRAM_STAGE_DATAENTRY_PARSER can be used to enter program stage related data for a
specific tracked entity instance.
642
Mobile SMS Command Type
Command name will be followed by data elements pertaining to specific program stage which this
command is associated with. Program and program stage selection will be done while creating this
command.
Default text pattern ( if field separator and codevalue separator is not provided ) for this parser would
look like this. programstage bcgd=1|opvd=2|wght=34
In case field separator is for example "," then text would look like this.programstage
bcgd=1,opvd=2,wght=34
Rest of the behavior is same as for other commands. If user does not provide those parameters then
default ones will be used.
SMS Command for Alerting, Registering
In order to alert users, we use SMS commands which have ALERT_PARSER (for phone's plain text),
or UNREGISTERED_PARSER (for j2me apps). UNREGISTERED_PARSER can also be used for
registering IDSR rumour.
643
Mobile SMS Service
The format of those command will be: [command's name] [text], for example:
alert one emergency case in A town
Commands which has ALERT_PARSER will be received from users only
SMS Command for Event Registration
Event Registration can be used to register anonymous event into the system based on the data
collected through SMS. This command type is associated with Programs of type
WITHOUT_REGISTRATION. For example Birth events can be tracked using this parser.
The format of those command will be: [command's name] [code][separator][value], for example:
birth A=1,B=2,G=Male
Code/Value separator is configurable. Pipe "|" is by default taken as field separator. Commands which
has EVENT_REGISTRATION_PARSER will be received from DHIS2 users only. Once command is
successfully received then data received in SMS will be parsed and event will be registered in DHIS2.
SMS Service
SMS Service is a generic service used for sending/receiving SMS. Any other DHIS2 module can
include this service and utilize it to send and receive SMS from users or workers in the field.
644
Mobile Setting up SMS service
Setting up SMS service
There are few pre-requisites in order to make this service functional. There are two ways to complete
these steps. One way is to configure gateway from the GUI in Mobile Configuration Module. The other
way is to use SMS Web Api.
• Configure SMS Gateway
Configure SMS Gateway
There are five different types of Gateways supported by SMS Service. SMS can be sent if any one of
the gateway is configured. If more than one gateways are present, then they will be used in round-
robin fashion for load balancing. There are different parameters for different type of gateway. The
Gateway can be configured in GUI in Mobile Configuration Module as shown in the figure. More
information about parameters needed to configure gateway can be found in [Gateway Configurations]
section of new SMS app.(#gateway.configuration)
Configure GenericHttp Gateway
Many DHIS2 instances are using GenericHttpGateway to connect to their local gateways. These local
gateways provides HTTP APIs for sending SMS. In new GenericHttpGateway it is now possible to
configure generic configuration template for gateway configuration. This template is converted into
request payload by replacing place holders with actual values taken from gateway key value
parameters.

Configuring SMS SMS Commands
Configuring SMS
This document covers the functionality of the SMS Configuration App. For additional information about
SMS service integration, please refer to the Mobile document.
SMS Commands
SMS commands process SMS messages received by a DHIS2 instance, taking certain actions
depending on the command and message content. Multiple SMS commands can be set up to process
and handle data in multiple ways. A SMS command is an object containing the configurations for each
SMS form: reporting data from phones or j2me apps, alerting users, registering patients or users, etc.
Listing available commands
To see all available commands, navigate to the "Commands" page. All commands will be listed in a
table. On this page the following actions are available:
• Add commands (1)
• Edit commands (2)
• Delete commands (3)
• Batch-delete commands (4)

These commands can have short codes for their associated program stage. Only programs of type
"Event program" can be chosen for this command. Therefore only one program stage exists, which will
be selected automatically.
Program stage data entry parser
These commands can have short codes for their associated program stage. Only programs of type
"Tracker program" can be chosen for this command. Unlike "Event registration" parsers, a program
stage has to be chosen for this parser type.
Editing commands
When editing commands, changing the parser type as well as the additional data supplied when
adding the command is not possible. The only way this is currently possible is by creating a new
command and deleting the old one.
There are certain parameters which are common to all SMS Command types. These parameters have
default values configured in the system, if user does provide any value to these parameters then those
default ones will be used. Here is the list of those parameters
These common fields are:
Parameter Type Description
Field Separator String To provide custom field separator.
Default is "|"
Reply message if no codes are String To provide message if no code is
sent (only the command) found in SMS text input. Default
is "Parameter missing"
653
Configuring SMS Editing commands
Parameter Type Description
Wrong format message String To provide message if command
is not formatted correctly.
Command should be formatted
as per code value separator. This
message will also be sent back if
any mandatory parameter is
missing.
No user message String To provide message if sending
phone number is not registered in
DHIS2.
User belong to more than one String Certain SMS command types
OrgUnit message require user ( retrieved from

of the process.
Some commands have the option to add short codes, which are explained in the individual sections
for each parser type down below.
Editing alert parser commands
When editing an alert parser command, only two fields are editable, the fields that are shared between
most parser types are not present:
• Name (required)
• Confirm message
Both are text fields.
Editing event registration parser commands
Commands of this parser type have all the shared fields. Additionally short codes can be defined. A
short code can be added for every data element connected to the program stage that was selected
when adding the command:

Editing J2ME parser commands
Commands of this parser type have all the shared fields. The SMS command will have a dataset
because those are used for reporting data. If data is reported for a Period which is already approved
then SMS response will be sent back containing information about approval status of the period.
Additionally short codes can be defined. Each command is connected to a dataset. The dataset has
data elements, which have category combos, which have at least one category option combo. For
every existing "data element - category option combo" combination, a short code can be provided.
Required values notice Make sure at least one SMS short code is provided when completeness
method "Receive at least one data value" is chosen, otherwise received messages will not be
processed.
Short code formulas
Each short code can have an optional formula. By providing a formula, the value of a different data
element can be either added or subtracted.
This can be done by clicking the "Add formula" / "Edit formula" button below the short code's input
field:

SMS Gateways
An SMS gateway lets a DHIS2 instance send and receive SMS messages. Different gateway types
can be added and configured below. At least one gateway is needed to send and receive SMS
messages. Load balancing will use all gateways if there are multiple available.
There are four types of Gateways supported by the SMS Service:
• Generic gateways
• BulkSMS gateways
• Clickatell gateways
• SMPP gateways

About data dimensions Data dimensions: Core building blocks in DHIS2
About data dimensions
Data dimensions: Core building blocks in DHIS2
A data value in DHIS2 is described by at least three dimensions: 1) data element, 2) organisation unit,
and 3) period. These dimensions form the core building blocks of the data model.
As an example, if you want to know how many children that were immunised for measles in Gerehun
CHC in December 2014, the three dimensions which describe that value are the data element
"Measles doses given", the organisation unit "Gerehun CHC", and the period "December 2014". All
data values have at least these three dimensions describing what, where, and when.
In addition to the data element, organisation unit, and period dimensions, data values may also be
associated with additional data dimensions. A common use of this feature is to describe data values
which are reported by multiple partners in the same location for the same data element and time
period. In principle, it can be used as a "free-form" dimension, to describe multiple observations of the
same phenomena at the same place and time. For more information about this, see Chapter 34:
Additional data dimensions.

The data element mentioned above ,"Measles doses given", can be further disaggregated into by
combinations of data element categories. Each system administrator of DHIS2 is free to define any
data element category dimensions for data elements. There are however, certain best practices which
should generally be followed.
664
About data dimensions Data element group sets
Given the example of Measles vaccination, if you want to know whether these vaccines were given at
the facility (fixed) or out in the community as part of the outreach services then you could add a
dimension called—e.g., "Place of service", with the two possible options "Fixed" and "Outreach". Then
all data collected on measles immunisation would have to be disaggregated along these to options. In
addition to this you might be interested in knowing how many of these children who were under 1 year
or above 1 year of age. If so you can add an Age dimension to the data element with the two possible
options "\<1 y" and ">1 y". This implies further detail on the data collection process. You can also apply
both categories "Place of service" and "Age" and combine these into a data element category
combination e.g. called "EPI disaggregation". You would then be able to look at four different more
detailed values in stead of only one as in the example above for the data element "Measles doses
given": 1) "Fixed and \<1 y, 2) Fixed and >1 y, 3) Outreach and \<1 y, and 4) Outreach and >1 y. This
adds complexity to how data is collected by the health facilities, but at the same time opens up for new
possibilities of detailed data analysis of Measles immunisation.

Data element group sets
While the data element categories and their options described above provide the level of detail
(disaggregation) at the point of data collection and how data values get stored in the database, the
data element group sets and groups can be used to add more information to data elements after data
collection. As an example, if you are analysing many data elements at the same time in a report, you
would want to group these based on some criteria. Instead of looking at all the data captured in a form
for immunisation and nutrition, you might want to separate or group data elements along a programme
dimension (known as a data element group set in DHIS2) where "Immunisation" (or EPI) and
"Nutrition" would be the two groups.
Expanding the report to include data from other programs or larger themes of health data would mean
more groups to such a group set dimension, like "Malaria", "Reproductive Health", "Stocks". For this
example, you would create a data element group set called "Programme" (or whatever name you find
appropriate), and to represent the different programmes in this dimension you would define data
elements groups called "EPI", "Nutrition", "Malaria", "Reproductive health" and so on, and add all
665
About data dimensions Organisation units: the where dimension
these groups to the "Programme" group set. To link or tag the data element "Measles doses given" to
such a dimension you must (in our example) add it to the "EPI" group. Which groups you add
"Measles doses given" to does not affect how health facilities collect the data, but adds more
possibilities to your data analysis. So for the group set dimensions there are three levels; the group set
(e.g. "Programme"), the group (e.g. "EPI"), and the data element (e.g. "Measles doses given").
Indicators can be grouped into indicator groups and further into indicator group sets (dimensions) in
exactly the same way as data elements.

Organisation units: the where dimension
Organisation units in DHIS2 should typically represent a location, such as a Community Health Centre
or referral hospitals, or an administrative unit like "MoHS Sierra Leone", "Bo District" or "Baoma
Chiefdom". In non-health sector applications, they could be "schools" or "water points". Orgunits are
represented in a default hierarchy, usually the default administrative hierarchy of a country or region,
and are therefore assigned an organisational level. As an example, Sierra Leone has four organisation
unit levels; National, District, Chiefdom, and Facility, and all orgunits are linked to one of these levels.
An orgunit hierarchy in DHIS2 can have any number of levels. Normally data is collected at the lowest
level, at the health facility, but can be collected at any level within the hierarchy, such as both the
districts as well as the facility level.
When designing reports at higher levels with data aggregated at the district or province level, DHIS2
will use the hierarchy structure to aggregate all the health facilities' data for any given unit at any level.
The organisation unit level capturing the data always represents the lowest level of detail that is
possible to use in data analysis, and the organisational levels define the available levels of
aggregation along a geographical dimension.
Organisation unit group sets and groups
While facility level is typically the lowest geographical level for disaggregation in DHIS2, there are
ways to flexibly group organisation units into any number of dimensions by using the organisation unit
groups and group set functionality. As an example, if all facilities are given an official type like
"Community health center" or "District Hospital, it is possible to create an organisation unit group set
called "Type" and add groups with the names of the types mentioned above. In order for the group
sets to function properly in analysis, each organisation unit should be a member of a single group
(compulsory and exclusive) within a group set. Stated somewhat differently, a facility should not be
both a "Community health center" as well as a "District hospital".
666
About data dimensions Best practice on the use of group sets and groups
Inherit the values of an organisation unit group set
You can improve the completeness of your aggregated data by inheriting the settings of a "parent"
organisation unit in your organisation unit hierarchy. This is particularly helpful if you are aggregating
the data of more than 100 organisation units. See the Maintenance app documentation for more
details.
Alternative organisation unit hierarchies - advanced use of group sets and groups
A more advanced use of organisation unit group sets is to create alternative hierarchies e.g. use
administrative borders from other ministries. In Sierra Leone that could mean an alternative hierarchy
of 1:MoHS, 2:Districts, and 3: Local councils, instead of the four-level hierarchy with chiefdoms and
facilities. For instance, if all facilities are linked to a specific local council, it would be possible to look at
data aggregated by local council instead of chiefdom. Then you would first need to create a group set
called "Local council" and then create one organisation unit group for every local council, and finally
link all facilities to their corresponding local council group.

Best practice on the use of group sets and groups
As mentioned above, all organisation units should be a member of a single group within a group set. If
an organisation unit is not present in any group or is present in multiple group members in a group set,
this can lead to unexpected results in the analysis modules. DHIS2 has integrity checks to identify
organisation units which are not present in any organisation unit group set member, or which is
present in multiple groups.
Period: the when dimension
The period dimension becomes an important factor when analysing data over time e.g. when looking
at cumulative data, when creating quarterly or annual aggregated reports, or when doing analysis that
combines data with different characteristics like monthly routine data, annual census/population data
or six-monthly staff data.
Period types
In DHIS2, periods are organised according to a set of fixed period types described below. The
following list is for the default ISO 8601 calendar type.
1. Daily
667
About data dimensions Relative periods
Weekly: The system supports various weekly period types, with Monday, Wednesday, Thursday,
2. 
Saturday and Sunday as the first day of the week. You collect data through data sets configured
to use the desired weekly period type. The analytics engine will attribute weekly data to the
month which contains four days or more of the week.
3. Bi-weekly: Two week periods beginning with the first week of the year.
4. Monthly: Refers to standard calendar months.
5. BiMonthly: Two-month periods beginning in January.
6. Quarterly: Standard ISO quarters, beginning in January.
7. SixMonthly: Six-month periods beginning in January
8. Yearly: This refers to a calendar year.
st st
9. Financial April: Financial year period beginning on April 1  and ending on March 31  of the
calendar next year
st st
10. Financial July: Financial year period beginning on July 1  and ending on June 31  of the
calendar next year
st st
11. Financial Oct: Financial year period beginning on October 1  and ending on September 31  of
the calendar next year
st
12. Six-monthly April: Six-month periods beginning on April 1  with a duration of six calendar
months.
As a general rule, all organisation units should collect the same data using the same frequency or
periodicity. A data entry form therefore is associated with a single period type to make sure data is
always collected according to the correct and same periodicity across the country.
It is possible however to collect the same data elements using different period types by assigning the
same data elements to multiple data sets with different period types, however then it becomes crucial
to make sure no organisation unit is collecting data using both data sets/period types as that would
create overlap and duplication of data values. If configured correctly the aggregation service in DHIS2
will aggregate the data together, e.g. the monthly data from one part of the country with quarterly data
from another part of the country into a national quarterly report. For simplicity and to avoid data
duplication it is advised to use the same period type for all organisation units for the same data
elements when possible.
Relative periods
In addition to the fixed period types described in the previous section, DHIS2 also support relative
periods for use in the analysis modules.
When creating analytical resources within DHIS2 it is possible to make use of the relative periods
functionality. The simplest scenario is when you want to design a monthly report that can be reused
every month without having to make changes to the report template to accommodate for the changes
in period. The relative period called "Last month" allows for this, and the user can at the time of report
generation through a report parameter select the month to use in the report.
A slightly more advanced use case is when you want to make a monthly summary report for
immunisation and want to look at the data from the current (reporting) month together with a
cumulative value for the year so far. The relative period called "This year" provides such a cumulative
value relative to the reporting month selecting when running the report. Other relative periods are the
last 3,6, or 12 months periods which are cumulative values calculated back from the selected reporting
668

month. If you want to create a report with data aggregated by quarters (the ones that have passed so
far in the year) you can select "Last four quarters". Other relative periods are described under the
reporting table section of the manual.

Aggregation of periods
While data needs to be collected on a given frequency to standardise data collection and
management, this does not put limitations on the period types that can be used in data analysis and
reports. Just like data gets aggregated up the organisational hierarchy, data is also aggregated
according to a period hierarchy, so you can create quarterly and annual reports based on data that is
being collected on a Monthly basis. The defined period type for a data entry form (data set) defines the
lowest level of period detail possible in a report.
Sum and average aggregation along the period dimension
When aggregating data on the period dimension there are two options for how the calculation is done,
namely sum or average. This option is specified on a per data element in DHIS2 through the use of
the 'aggregation operator' attribute in the Add/Edit Data Elements dialog.
Most of the data collected on a routinely basis should be aggregated by summing up the months or
weeks, for instance to create a quarterly report on Measles immunisation one would sum up the three
monthly values for "Measles doses given".
Other types of data that are more permanently valid over time like "Number of staff in the facility" or an
annual population estimate of "Population under 1 year" need to be aggregated differently. These
values are static for all months as long as there are valid data. For example, the "Estimated population
under 1", calculated from the census data ,is the same for all months of a given year, or the number of
nurses working in a given facility is the same for every month in the 6 months period the number is
reported for.
This difference becomes important when calculating an annual value for the indicator morbidity service
burden for a facility. The monthly head-counts are summed up for the 12 months to get the annual
headcount, while the number of staff for the facility is calculated as the average of the two 6-monthly
values reported through the 6-monthly staff report. So in this example the data element "OPD
headcount" would have the aggregation operator "SUM" and the data element "Number of staff" would
have it set to "AVERAGE".
669
About data dimensions Data collection vs. data analysis
Another important feature of average data elements is the validity period concept. Average data
values are standing values for any period type within the borders of the period they are registered for.
For example, an annual population estimate following the calendar year, will have the same value for
any period that falls within that year no matter what the period type. If the population under 1 for a
given facility is 250 for the year of 2015 that means that the value will be 250 for Jan-15, for Q3-15, for
Week 12 of 2015 and for any period within 2015. This has implications for how coverage indicators are
calculated, as the full annual population will be used as denominator value even when doing monthly
reports. If you want to look at an estimated annual coverage value for a given month, then you will
have the option of setting the indicator to "Annualised" which means that a monthly coverage value
will be multiplied by a factor of 12, a quarterly value by 4, in order to generate an effective yearly total.
The annualised indicator feature can therefore be used to mimic the use of monthly population
estimates.
Data collection vs. data analysis
Data collection and storage
Datasets determine what raw data that is available in the system, as they describe how data is
collected in terms of periodicity as well as spatial extent. Data sets define the building blocks of the
data to be captured and stored in DHIS2. For each data dimension we decide what level of detail the
data should be collected at namely 1) the data element (e.g. diagnosis, vaccine, or any event taking
place) and its categories (e.g. age and gender), 2) the period/frequency dimension, and 3) the
organisation unit dimension. For any report or data analysis you can never retrieve more detailed data
than what is defined in the data sets, so the design of the datasets and their corresponding data entry
forms (the data collection tools) dictate what kind of data analysis will be possible.
Input does not equal Output
It is important to understand that the data entry forms or datasets themselves are not intrinsically
linked to the underlying data value and that the meaning of data is only described by the data element
(and its categories). This makes it perfectly safe to modify datasets and forms without altering the data
(as long as the data elements stay the same). This loose coupling between forms and data makes
DHIS2 flexible when it comes to designing and changing new forms and in providing exactly the form
the users want.
Another benefit of only linking data to data elements and not to forms, is the flexibility of creating
indicators and validation rules based on data elements, and also in providing any kind of output report
(in pivot tables, charts, maps etc.) that can combine data individually or across forms, e.g. to correlate
data from different health programs. Due to this flexibility of enabling integration of data from various
programs (forms) and sources (routine and semi permanent (population, staff, equipment)) a DHIS2
database is used as an integrated data repository for many or all parts of the aggregated data in a
larger HIS. The figure below illustrates this flexibility.
670
About data dimensions Extended examples of data elements and forms
In this example, we see that data elements from multiple forms can be combined to create a given
indicator. As a more concrete example, one might collect "Population under one year of age" in an
annual data set by district, and then collect a data element like "Fully immunized children" by month at
the facility level. By annualizing the population, we can generate an approximation of the effective
monthly population, and combining this with the aggregate total of the number of fully immunized
children by month, it would be possible to generate an indicator "Fully immunized coverage",
consisting of the aggregated total of children who are fully immunized, divided by the effective monthly
population.
Extended examples of data elements and forms
The table below combines data element the two group sets Diagnosis (all the diseases) and Morbidity/
Mortality (New cases, Follow-ups, Referrals, Deaths) with the data element category PHU/Community.
Deaths are captured in a separate form with other dimensions (e.g. the PHU/Community) than
morbidity.

This output table combines the two data element categories HIV_Age and Gender with the data

the data elements in that group. Subtotals for either age groups and gender would be other possible
columns to easily include here.

About data dimensions How this works in pivot tables
How this works in pivot tables
When doing data analysis in Excel pivot tables or any other OLAP based tool the dimensions become
extremely powerful in providing many different views into the data. Each data element category or
group set become a pivot field, and the options or groups become values within each of these fields.
In fact categories and groupsets are treated exactly the same way in pivot tables, and so are orgunits,
periods, and data elements. All these become dimensions to the data value that can be used to
rearrange, pivot, filter, and to drill down into the data. Here we will show some examples of how the
data dimensions are used in pivot tables.
Using the example of morbidity and mortality data, a pivot table can show how the dimensions can be
used to view data for different aggregation levels.
The completely aggregated number is viewed when none of the pivot fields are arranged in the table
area, as column or row fields, but are listed above the table itself as page field (filter).
673
About data dimensions How this works in pivot tables
Here we have selected to look at the Morbidity total. The various data elements on morbidity have
been ordered into the main_de_groups Morbidity (we will get back to Mortality later). The fields above
the table itself are all set to "All", meaning that the totals in the table will contain data from all
Countries, Districts, Chiefdom, ou_type, year, months, the various categories as listed in the red fields,
and all data elements in the Morbidity group.
As we have seen, this is not a very useful representation, as Morbidity is organized into new cases,
follow-ups, referrals, and then again in age groups. Also, we do not see the various diagnoses. The
first step is to include the diagnoses field (which is a group set), which is done by dragging the
"diagnosis" field down to be a row field, as shown in the figure below, and to add the group set called
"morbiditymortality" in the column field to display new cases, follow-up, and referrals.
Contrast this figure above to the one below.
674
About data dimensions How this works in pivot tables
They both show the same data (some of the rows have been cut in the screenshot due to image size),
albeit in a different way.
• The "dataelement" field, used in the bottom figure, displays each diagnosis as three elements;
one follow-up, one new, and one referrals. This is the way the data elements have been defined
in DHIS2, as this makes sense for aggregation. You would not like to aggregate follow-ups and
new, thus these have not been made as categories, the whole point of is to ease aggregation
and disaggregation.
• The "diagnosis" group set has instead been made to lump these three (follow-up, new,
referrals) together, which can then be split with another group set, namely the one called
"morbiditymortality". This allows us to organize the data as in the first of the two figures, where
we have the single diagnosis per row, and the groups new, follow-up, referrals as rows.
The idea of using group sets is that you can combine, in any set, different data elements. Thus, if we
add the mortality data (by checking it from the drop-down menu of the main_de_groups field, and
moving this field out of the table) we can see also the deaths, since the mortality data elements have
been included as a "death" group in the "morbiditymortality" group set. The result is shown below.
675
About data dimensions How this works in pivot tables
The result is a much more user-friendly pivot table. Now, another figure shows the relationship
between the group sets and elements (these are fake data values).
This small detail of the pivot table show how the actual data elements link to the group sets:
• The four data elements, as defined in DHIS2, are Measles death, Measles follow-up, Measles
new, and Measles referrals
• They all belong to the group set "diagnosis", where they have been lumped together in the
group Measles
• The group set "morbiditymortality" contains the groups New cases, Follow-up, Referrals, and
Deaths.
• Only the data element Measles deaths has data related to the group Deaths, thus this is where
the data value (20) is shown, at the upper right corner. The same for Measles new; the value
(224) is shown at the intersection of the data element Measles new and the group New cases
(in the group set morbiditymortality)
• All the intersections where the data element does not link with the groups in morbiditymortality
are left blank. Thus in this case we would get a nice table if we excluded the data element from
the table, and just had diagnosis and the group set morbiditymortality, as in the figure shown
earlier
Now lets see how the data element categories can be used. In the data entry form for Morbidity the
new cases and follow-ups use one age category, the referral data another,, and the mortality data a
third age breakup, so these are available as three individual age group fields in the pivot tables called
morbidity_age, referrals_age and mortality_age. It doesn't make sense to use these while looking at
these data together (as in the examples above), but e.g. if we only want to look at the only the new
cases we can put the MobidityMortalityGroups field back up as a page field and there select the New
cases group as a filter. Then we can drag the Morbidity_age field down to the column area and we get
the following view:
676
About data dimensions How this works in pivot tables
The following table illustrates the benefits of reusing data element categories across datasets and
category combinations. The VCCT, ART and PMTCT data are collected in three different datasets, the
first two with both gender and age breakdown, and the PMTCT only age (gender is given). All three
share the same age groups and therefore it is possible to view data elements from all these three
datasets in the same table and use the age dimension. In the previous example with morbidity and
mortality data this was not possible since new cases, referrals and deaths all have different age
groups.
677
About data dimensions How this works in pivot tables
In the table below PMTCT data has been removed from the table and the gender category added to
the column area so that you can analyse the data for VCCT and ART by age and gender. An optional
subtotal for gender has also been added, as well as a grand total for all age and gender.

About data dimensions Case study: From paper forms to multidimensional datasets - lessons learned
Case study: From paper forms to multidimensional datasets - lessons learned
Typically the design of a DHIS2 dataset is based on some requirements from a paper form that is
already in use. The logic of paper forms are not the same as the data element and data set model of
DHIS2, e.g. often a field in a tabular paper form is described both by column headings and text on
each row, and sometimes also with some introductory table heading that provides more context. In the
database this is captured in one atomic data element with no reference to a position in a visual table
format, so it is important to make sure the data element with the optional data element categories
capture the full meaning of each individual field in the paper form.
Another important thing to have in mind while designing datasets is that the dataset and the
corresponding data entry form (which is a dataset with layout) is a data collection tool and not a report
or analysis tool. There are other far more sophisticated tools for data output and reporting in DHIS2
than the data entry forms. Paper forms are often designed with both data collection and reporting in
mind and therefore you might see things such as cumulative values (in addition to the monthly values),
repetition of annual data (the same population data reported every month) or even indicator values
such as coverage rates in the same form as the monthly raw data. When you store the raw data in
DHIS2 every month and have all the processing power you need within the computerised tool there is
no need (in fact it would be stupid and most likely cause inconsistency) to register manually calculated
values such as the ones mentioned above. You only want to capture the raw data in your datasets/
forms and leave the calculations to the computer, and presentation of such values to the reporting
tools in DHIS2.
From tables to category combinations - designing multi-dimensional data sets
As we have seen in the examples above, data element categories and category options are helpful in
representing tabular data, when adding dimensions to a field in a paper form. We have also seen how
the data element is one of the required dimensions which describe data in DHIS2. As we will see in
the example below there are often more than one way to represent a paper form in DHIS2 , and it can
be difficult to know which dimension to represent with a data element name and which to represent as
679
About data dimensions From tables to category combinations - designing multi-dimensional data sets
categories, or even as groups as we have seen above. Here are some general lessons learned from
working with data element and category combinations:
• Design your dimensions with data use in mind, not data collection. This means that
disaggregation of data values at collection time should be easily aggregated up along the
various dimensions, as in adding up to a meaningful total.
• Reuse dimensions as much as possible as this increases the ability to compare disaggregated
data (e.g. age groups, fixed/outreach, gender).
• Disaggregation dimensions should add up to a total. In certain cases, data elements may be
collected a subsets of each other. In this case, use of categories to disaggregate the data
element should not be used. As an example, we might collect "Number of confirmed malaria
cases" and disaggregate this by "Under 5" and "Over 5". A third data element "Number of
confirmed malaria cases under 1" might also exist on the form. It would seem reasonable then
to create three age groups : Under 1, Under 5 and Over 5, to describe the disaggregation.
However, the Under 1 is actually a subset of the Under 5 group, and when totalled, would result
in duplication. Thus, categories should be generally be composed of mutually exclusive
category options, such that the sum of individual category options results in a coherent total.
• Different levels of dimensions; 1) disaggregation and 2) grouping. Disaggregation dimensions
dictate how you collect and how detailed you store your data, so plan these carefully. The group
dimension is more flexible and can be changed and added to even after data collection (think of
it as tagging).
• It is best to think of how the data would be used in an integrated data repository and not how it
will actually be collected on forms or by programs when designing the meta-data model. Ideally,
the same type of disaggregation should be used across forms and datasets for data elements
which will be analysed together, or used to build indicators. Reuse definitions so that the
database can integrate even though the forms themselves might be duplicated (which in
practice, is often the case).
In order to better explain the approach and the possibilities we present an example paper form and will
walk through it step by step and design data elements, categories, category options and category
combinations.
680
About data dimensions From tables to category combinations - designing multi-dimensional data sets
This form has many tables and each of them potentially represent a data element category
combination (from now on referred to as a catcombo). As such there is no restriction on a dataset to
only have one set of dimensions or catcombo, it can have many and as we see above this is
necessary as the dimensions are very different from table to table. In the following paragraphs, we will
analyse how to break down this form into its component pieces and suggest an implementation
pathway in DHIS2.
ANC table. This table in the top left corner is one the simpler ones in this form. It has two dimensions,
st nd
the first column with the ANC activity or service (1  visit, IPT 2  dose etc) and the second and third
681
About data dimensions From tables to category combinations - designing multi-dimensional data sets
column which represent the place where the service was given with the two options "Fixed" and
"Outreach". Since the ANC service is the key phenomena to analyse here, and often there is a need
st
for looking at the total of "ANC 1  visits" no matter where they actually took placed, it makes a lot of
sense to use this dimension as the data element dimension.
st nd
Thus, all items on the first column from "1  ANC" visit to "2  IPT dose given by TBA" are represented
as individual data elements. The where dimension is represented as a data element category (from
now on referred to as category) with the name "fixed/outreach" with the two data element category
options (from now on catoptions) "fixed" and "outreach". There is no other dimension here so we add a
new catcombo with the name "Fixed/Outreach" with one category "Fixed/Outreach". Strictly speaking
there is another dimension in this table, and that is the at PHU or by TBA dimension which is repeated
for the two doses of IPT, but since none of the other ANC services listed have this dimension it does
not seem like a good idea to separate out two data elements from this table and give them another
catcombo with both fixed/outreach and at PHU/by TBA. reusing the same catcombo for all the ANC
services makes more sense since it will be easier to look at these together in reports etc. and also the
fact that there is not much to lose by repeating the at PHU or by TBA information as part of the data
element name when it is only for four data elements in a table of eleven data elements.
DELIVERY table. This table is more tricky as it has a lot of information and you can see that not all the
rows have the same columns (some columns are merged and a one field is greyed out/disabled.). If
we start by looking at the first column "Deliveries assisted by" that seems to be one dimension, but
only down to the "Untrained TBA" row, as the remaining three rows are not related to who assisted the
delivery at all. Another dimension is the place of delivery, either In PHU or in Community as stated on
the top column headings. These deliveries are further split into the outcome of the delivery, whether it
is a live or still birth, which seems to be another dimension. So if we disregard the three bottom rows
for a moment there seems to be 3 dimensions here, 1) assisted by, 2) place of delivery, and 3) delivery
outcome. The key decision to make is what to use as the data element, the main dimension, the total
that you will most often use and want easily available in reports and data analysis.
In this case, the outcome dimension as "Total live births" is a very commonly used value in many
indicators (maternal mortality ratio, births attended by skilled health personnel etc.). In this case the
"Assisted By" dimension could also have been used without any problem, but the added value of
easily getting the total live births information was the decisive point for us. This means that from this
table (or sub-table of row 1 to 6) there are only two data elements; "Live births" and "Still births".
Next, there are two more dimensions, the "PHU/Community" with its two options and a "Births
attended by" with options ("MCH Aides", "SECHN", "Midwives", "CHO", "Trained TBA", "Untrained
TBA"). These two categories make up the catcombo "Births" which is assigned to the two data
elements "Live births" and "Still births". Considering the final three rows of the delivery table we can
see that "Complicated Deliveries" does not have the assisted by dimension, but has the place and the
outcome. "Low birth weight" also does not have the assisted by dimension and not the outcome either.
The LLITN given after delivery does not have any additional dimension at all. Since not any of the
three rows can share catcombo with any other row we decided to represent these fields as so called
flat data elements, meaning data elements with no categories at all, and simply adding the additional
information from the column headings to the data element name, and therefore ended up with the
following data elements with the default (same as none) catcombo; "Complicated deliveries in PHU
live birth", "Complicated deliveries in PHU still births", "Complicated deliveries in community live birth",
"Complicated deliveries in community still births", "Low birth weight in PHU", "Low birth weight in
community", and "LLITN given after delivery".
POST-NATAL CARE table This table is simple and we used the same approach as for the ANC table.
3 data elements listed in the first column and then link these to the catcombo called "fixed/outreach".
Reusing the same category fixed/outreach for these data elements enables analysis on fixed/outreach
together with ANC data and other data using the same category.

About data dimensions Step-by-step approach to designing datasets
TT table This table is somewhat more complex than the previous examples.We decided to use "TT1",
"TT2" ... "TT5" as data elements which makes it easy to get the total of each one of these. There is
fixed/outreach dimension here, but there is also the "In school place" that is only applied to the Non-
Pregnant, or more correctly to any of the two as the school immunisation is done whether the girls are
pregnant or not. We consulted the program people behind the form and found out that it would be OK
to register all school TT immunisations as non-pregnant, which simplifies the model a bit since we can
reuse the "TT1" to "TT5" data elements. So we ended up with a new category called "TT place" with
the three options (Fixed, Outreach, In School), and another category called "Pregnant/Non-pregnant"
with two options. The new catcombo "TT" is then a combination of these two and applied to the 5 TT
data elements. Since we agreed to put all In Schools immunisations under Non-pregnant in means
that the combination of options (Pregnant+In School) will never be used in any data entry form, and
hence become a possible optioncombo, which is OK. As long as the form is custom designed then you
can choose which combinations of options to use or not, and therefore it is not a problem to have such
passive or unused catoptions. Having school as one option in the TT place category simplifies the
model and therefore we thought it was worth it. The alternative would be to create 5 more data
elements for "TT1 in school" ... "TT5 in school", but then it would be a bit confusing to add these
together with the "TT1" ..."TT5" plus TT catcombo. Having school as a place in the TT place category
makes it a lot easier to get the total of TT1.. TT5 vaccines given, which are the most important
numbers and most often used values for data analysis.
Complications of early and late pregnancy and labour tables We treat these two tables as one,
and will explain why. These two tables are a bit confusing and not the best design. The most important
data coming out of these tables are the pregnancy complications and the maternal deaths. These data
elements contain further detail on the cause of the complication or death (the first column in both
tables), as well as a place of death (in PHU or community), and an outcome of the complication (when
its not a death) that can be either "Managed at PHU" or " Referred". We decided to create two data
elements for these two tables; "Pregnancy complications", and "Maternal Deaths", and two category
combinations, one for each of the data elements. For the Pregnancy Complications data element there
are two additional dimensions, the cause of the complication (the combined list of the first column in
the two tables) and the outcome (managed at PHU or Referred), so these are the categories and
options that make up that category combination. For the "Maternal deaths" data element the same
category with the different causes are used and then another category for the place of death (in PHU
or In community). This way the two data elements can share one category and it will be easy to derive
the total number of pregnancy complications and maternal deaths. While the list of complications on
nd
the paper form is divided into two (early and late/labour) you can see that e.g. the malaria in 2  and
rd
3  trimester are listed under early, but in fact are for a later phase of the pregnancy. There is no clear
divide between early and late complications in the form, and therefore we gave up trying to make this
distinction in the database.
Family Planning Services table This table has 2 dimensions, the family planning method
(contraceptive) and whether the client is new or continuing. We ended up with one data element only
"Family planning clients" and then added two categories "FP method" with all the contraceptives as
options, and another category "FP client type" with new or continuing as options. This way it will be
easy to get the total number of family planning clients which is the major value to look at in data
analysis, and from there you can easily get the details on method or how many new clients there are.
Step-by-step approach to designing datasets
1. Identify the different tables (or sub datasets) in the paper form that share the same dimensions
2. For each table identify the dimensions that describe the data fields
3. Identify the key dimension, the one that makes most sense to look at in isolation (when the
others are collapsed, summed up). This is your data element dimension, the starting point and
core of your multidimensional model (sub dataset). The data element dimension can be a
merger of two or more dimensions if that makes more sense for data analysis. The key is to
683
About data dimensions Step-by-step approach to designing datasets
identify which total that makes most sense to look at alone when the other dimensions are
collapsed.
4. For all other/additional dimensions identify their options, and come up with explanatory names
for dimensions and their options.
5. Each of these additional dimensions will be a data element category and their options will be
category options.
6. Combine all categories for each sub dataset into one category combination and assign this to
all the data elements in your table (or sub dataset if you like).
7. When you are done with all the tables (sub datasets), create a new dataset and add all the data
elements you have identified (in the whole paper form) to that dataset.
8. Your dataset will then consist of a set of data elements that are linked to one or more category
combinations.
684
Additional data dimensions About additional data dimensions
Additional data dimensions
About additional data dimensions
DHIS2 has the ability to add dimensions to data in addition to what was described in the previous
chapter. We will call these dimensions “attribute categories” (ACs). The categories described in the
previous chapter we will call “disaggregation categories” (DCs) to differentiate them from ACs.
ACs and DCs are quite similar—they work in much the same way, are accessed through the same
part of the maintenance interface, and exist in the same part of the database. The main difference
between them is what they are connected to. A DC is attached to a data element; however, an AC is
attached to a data set. This means values for all DC options can be entered on the same data entry
screen, whereas you must choose the AC option before you begin to enter data.
In setting up a system, you could just use DCs and ignore ACs altogether. However, ACs are a way to
simplify data entry screens or reduce the size of the cross-product of category option combos.
Tip
When you’re deciding which categories should be DCs and which should
be ACs, here’s a good rubric:
• Use DCs when you want to use different combinations of categories
on different data elements within a data set
• Use DCs when you want to enter all the category option
combinations on one data entry screen
• Use ACs when you want to use the same combination of categories
for all the data in a data set
• Use ACs when you want to enter only one category option
combination on one data entry screen
While we referred to DCs as part of the what dimension for simplicity in the former chapter, it’s actually
more complex. Either DCs or ACs can answer any question about a data element, including what (of
course), who, why, how, or even a where or a when beyond the organisation unit and period
dimensions.
Create or edit an attribute category and its options
The process of creating an attribute category as well as its options and combinations, is discussed in
the section Manage categories. As noted there, disaggregation categories are configured by editing a
data element and attribute categories are configured by editing a data set.
Data entry with disaggregation categories and attribute categories
When entering aggregate data, one must first choose the attribute categories, and then one can enter
the data across disaggregation categories on a single page.
For instance, in the graphic below, the attribute categories are Implementing Partner (AIDSRelief
Consortium) and Project (Improve access to medicines). The disaggregation categories are gender
(male/female/etc.), age (<15, 15-24, 25-49, >49).
685
Additional data dimensions Analysis with disaggregation categories and attribute categories
Analysis with disaggregation categories and attribute categories
In order to do analysis with disaggregation and attribute categories, check the “Data dimension” box in
the category editing screen of the Maintenance app, as discussed in Create or edit a category.
Approvals with attribute categories
To include attribute categories in approvals, create a category option group that contains the same
category options as the attribute category. Then create a category option group set and add that the
category option group set as a data approval level.
This is covered in more detail in the section Approving by category option group set and Approving by
multiple category option group sets.
Attribute categories and the datavalue table
For some, the way attribute categories work with disaggregation categories is clearer when we look at
how the data values are stored in DHIS2’s database. If diving into the database internals doesn’t help
you understand how the different types of categories work together, please feel free to ignore it.
Each data value is associated with a data element, a period, and an organisation unit, which are
represented in this way:
dataelementid perio sourc    
did eid
(Note these are numeric database ids, not DHIS2 uids.)
And of course, each data value has a value, adding the value column to the database:
dataelementid perio sourc va   
did eid lue
686
Additional data dimensions Attribute categories and the datavalue table
Each data value also references the disaggregation category options and the attribute category
options assigned to it. For instance, in the example above, the data value entered in the box “Male
<15” will have the option “Male” for the disaggregation category gender, and the option “<15” for the
disaggregation category age. The combination of these two options is represented in the database by
a single category option combination meaning “Male, <15”. The data value references this
disaggregation category option combination in the categoryoptioncomboid:
dataelementid perio sourc va categoryoptioncomboid  
did eid lue
Likewise, the same data value will have the option “AIDSRelief Consortium” for the category 
Implementing Partner, and the option “Improve access to medicines” for the category Project. There
will also be a database category option combination meaning “Implementing Partner, Improve
access to medicines”. The data value references this attribute category option combination in the 
attributeoptioncomboid:
dataelementid perio sourc va categoryoptioncomboid attributeoptioncomboid
did eid lue
Note
The above column list does not include all of the columns in the datavalue
table.
If you have not defined a disaggregation category combination for a data element, the
categoryoptioncomboid will reference a “default” category option combination, which is defined
internally in DHIS2 as the category default with the option default (the only option in the default
category). Likewise, if you have not defined an attribute category combination for the dataset in which
you enter the data, the attributeoptioncomboid references the same “default” category option
combination.
We hope this investigation of how data values are stored in DHIS2’s database makes it clearer how
data values can be associated with various groups of category options, both from disaggregation
categories and attribute categories.
687
Relationship model Relationship Type
Relationship model
A relationship represents a link between two entities in the Tracker-model. A relationship is considered
data in DHIS2 and is based on a Relationship Type, similar to how a Tracked Entity Instance is based
on a Tracked Entity Type.
Relationships always include two entities, and these entities can include Tracked Entity Instances,
Enrollments and Events, and any combination of these. Note that not all of these combinations are
available in the current apps.
In addition, relationships can be defined as unidirectional or bidirectional. The only functional
difference is currently that these requires different levels of access to create. Unidirectional
relationships requires the user to have data write access to the "from" entity and data read access for
the "to" entity, while bidirectional relationships require data write access for both sides.
Relationship Type
A Relationship Type is the definition of the properties a relationship have. Relationships always
consists of two sides, referred to as "from" and "to", and what entities can be contained for each side
is determined by the Relationship Type. The properties that determine what each can contain are
called constraints, fromConstraint and toConstraint respectively. These constraints are significant
when working with the data later, to understand what a relationship can and cannot contain.
Each of the constraints defined in the Relationship Type consists of several properties. The primary
property is the relationship entity, which decides what kind of entities the relationship can contain. The
entities can be one of the following for each constraint:
• Tracked Entity Instance
• Enrollment
• Event
Depending on the kind of relationship entity you select, you can choose additional limitations for each
constraint. The following table explains the different combinations you can configure:
Tracked Entity
Enrollment Event
Instance
Tracked Entity Type Required Optional -
Program - Required -
Program Stage - Required Optional
These additional limitations, will require the entity to match the limitation set before it can be created.
For example, if your relationship is between a mother and a child, both constraints would have their
required Tracked Entity Type set to Person and could optionally set the Enrollment to Maternal Health
Program and Child Program respectively. This way, only Tracked Entity Instances who are of type
Person and who is enrolled in the required program is allowed to be included in these relationships.
In addition to the constrains a Relationship Type can have, each relationship can be set to
bidirectional, true or false. If the property is set to false, the relationships are treated as unidirectional.
As previously mentioned, the only functional difference between these relationships are how strict the
access is when creating or updating them - bidirectional being the strictest. Relationships are also
presented differently in the UI based on whether or not the relationship is bidirectional or
unidirectional.
688
Relationship model Relationship Type
One important thing to note about bidirectional relationships, are that the "from" and "to" sides are still
significant in the database, meaning each entity must match the constraint for that side. However, from
a user perspective, which side each entity is stored as is insignificant.

DHIS2 Glossary A
DHIS2 Glossary

Aggregation : In the context of DHIS2, aggregation refers to how data elements are combined within a
particular hierarchical relationship. As an example, all the health facilities in a particular district would
contribute to the total value for the particular district in question. Different aggregation operators are
supported within DHIS2, such as SUM, AVERAGE, and COUNT.
Analytics : Analytics refers to the process which processes and prepares data which has been entered
into DHIS2 into a format which is more suitable for retrieving indicators and aggregated data. When
data is entered into DHIS2, it is stored in a format which is optimized for writing the data. However,
when data needs to be processed into indicators or aggregated (e.g from months to quarters), it is
more efficient to transform and store this data in a different format which is optimized for read-only
operations. The analytics system of DHIS2 is used extensively by the analytics apps (GIS, Pivot Table,
Event reports, etc.).
It is important to keep in mind that because the data which has been
entered into DHIS2 must be processed into the analytics format, the
data which appears in the analytics apps only represents the data
which was present in the system the last time analytics was run. If
data has been entered after that, analytics will need to be run
again for this data to appear in the analytics apps.
Aggregate data : In the context of DHIS2, aggregate data refers to either data elements or indicators
that have been derived from other hierarchical data sources. For instance, aggregate facility data
would result from the aggregate totals of all patients that have attended that facility for a particular
service. Aggregate district data would result from the aggregate totals of all facilities contained with a
particular district.
Application programming interface : An application programming interface is a specification of how
different software components should interact with each other. The DHIS2 API (or WebAPI) can be
used to interface DHIS2 with other software, to build reports or custom data entry forms.
Approvals : Approvals can be used to control the visibility and editibility of data. When data is
submitted from the lowest reporting level, it can be approved by the next higher level. This approval
has two effects:
1.  Data is no longer able to be edited in the data entry screens at
    the lower level.
2.  Depending on the system settings which have been enabled, the
    data will become visible at the approval level.
As an example, data is entered at the facility level, and the
submitted for approval. Once the data has been approved at the
district level, the data will become locked in the data entry
screens for the facility level. It will also become visible in the
analytics apps to district users.
B
st th
Bi-monthly : Refers to a two-month period, such as January 1  to February 28 .
690
DHIS2 Glossary C

Category : Categories are groups of category options. The are used in combinations to disaggregate
data elements. Categories are typically a single type of concept, such as "Age" or "Gender".
Category combinations : Category combinations are used to disaggregate data elements. As an
example, the data element "Number of confirmed cases of malaria" could be disaggregated
subdivided into to categories: "Age" and "Gender". In turn each of these categories, would consist of
several category options, such as "Male" and "Female" for the gender category. Category
combinations may consist of one or several categories.
Category combination options : Category combination options are dynamically composed of all of the
different combinations of category options which compose a category combination. As an example,
two categories "Gender" and "Age", might have options such as "Male" or "Female" and "<5 years" or
">5 years". The category combination options would then consist of:
- Male <5 years
- Male >5 years
- Female <5 years
- Female >5 years
Category option : Category options are atomic elements that are grouped into categories.
Comma separated values : Comma separated values are series of tabular data stored in a plain-text
format. They are commonly used with DHIS2 to export and import data values.
D
Data dictionary : A collection of data elements and indicators, which can be exchanged with other
DHIS2 systems. Typically used to define a set of data elements and indicators when setting up the
DHIS2 system.
Data exchange format : In the context of DHIS2, the "data exchange format" refers to a XML schema
that enables the transportation of data and meta-data between disconnected DHIS2 instances, as well
as between different applications that support the DXF schema.
Datamart : A set of database tables in DHIS2 that contains processed data elements and indicator
values that is generated based on aggregation rules and calculated data element and indicator
formulae. Datamart tables are used for analysis and report production. Typically, users should not
work directly with unaggregated data values, but rather with values that have resulted from a datamart
export for analysis.
Data element : A data element is the fundamental building block of DHIS2. It is an atomic unit of data
with well-defined meaning. Essentially it is a data value that has been actually observed or recorded
which is further characterized by a number of dimensions. As an example the data element "Number
of fully immunized children" would refer to the number of children that received this particular service.
Data elements are always linked to a period as well as an organizational unit. They optionally may be
linked to other dimensions.
Data element group : Data element groups are used to categorize multiple data elements according to
a common theme, such as "Immunization" or "ART". Typically, they are used during reporting and
analysis to allow related data elements to be analysed together.
Data element group sets : Data element groups are used to categorize multiple data element groups
into a common theme.
691
DHIS2 Glossary H
Dimension : A dimension is used to categorize data elements during analysis. Dimensions provide a
mechanism to group and filter data based on common characteristics. Typically, related data elements
may be aggregated or filtered during analysis with the use of dimensions. Dimensions may be a
member of a hierarchy. For instance the "Period" dimension may be broken down into "Day->Month-
>Quarter->Year".
DXF
H
Health management information system : Typically, an electronic database system that is used to
record aggregated data on service delivery, disease incidence, human resource data and other
information used to evaluate the performance of delivery of health services. Typically, an HMIS does
not contain the highly detailed data of electronic medical record systems or individual patient data.
I
Indicator : The divisor of an indicator. Can be composed of multiple data elements with the use of an
indicator formula.
\[
Indicator = {\frac{Numerator}{Denominator}}
\]
This is obviously a very generalized example. The numerator and
indicator themselves can be composed of various data elements,
factors, and the four basic operands (addition, multiplication,
division and subtraction).
N
Numerator : The dividend of a indicator. Can be composed of multiple data elements and factors with
the use of indicator formulas.
O
Organisational unit : An organisational unit is usually a geographical unit, which exists within a
hierarchy. As an example, in the United States, "Georgia" would be considered an organisational unit
with in the orgunit level of "State". Organizational units can also be used to specify an administrative
unit, such as a ward within a hospital. The organisational unit dimension specifies essentially where a
particular data value occurs.
Organisational unit level : Refers to a level within an organizational hierarchy. Typically, countries are
administered at different levels, such as 1) Country 2) States 3) Counties 4) Health facilities. In the
context of DHIS2, health facilities typically are the lowest orgunit level. Data is aggregated upwards
from the lowest orgunit level to the highest.
P
Period : A period is a specific time interval which consists of a start date and end date. For instance
st st
"January 2011" would refer to the time interval of January 1  2011-January 31  2011.
U
Unique identifier : A unique identifier (UID) is a semi-random series of letters and numbers used by
DHIS2 to identify specific resources. UIDs begin with a letter, and are followed by exactly 10 letters or
digits.

Using the DHIS2 demo server
The DHIS2 team maintains a demonstration server at https://play.dhis2.org/demo. This is by far the
easiest way to try out DHIS2. Simply open the link in your web browser and login with username =
admin and password = district.
Note
All changes on this server are deleted each night, so do not save any
important work on this server. It is strictly for demonstration purposes on
only!
Using the DHIS2 live package
Starting the DHIS2 Live package
The DHIS2 Live package is the easiest way to get started with DHIS2 on your local computer. DHIS2
Live is appropriate for a stand-alone installation and demos. Simply download the application from 
here. Once the file is downloaded, you can simply double-click the downloaded file, and get started
using DHIS2.
Prerequisites for DHIS2 Live
You must be sure that you have a current version of the Java Runtime installed on your machine.
Depending on your operating system, there are different ways of installing Java. The reader is referred
to this website for detailed information on getting Java installed.
Starting up with a blank database
The live package comes with a demo database just like what you see on the online demo (which is
based on the national Sierra Leone HMIS), and if you want to start with a blank system/database and
build up your own system then you need to do the following:
1) Stop DHIS2 live if it is already running. Right click on the tray icon and select Exit. The tray icon is
the green symbol on the bottom right of your screen (on Windows) which should say' DHIS2 Server
running' when you hover your mouse pointer over the icon.
2) Open the folder where the DHIS2 live package is installed and locate the folder called "conf".
3) In conf/ open the file called 'hibernate.properties' in a text editor (notepad or similar) and do the
following modification: locate the string 'jdbc:h2:./database/dhis2' and replace the 'dhis2' part with any
name that you want to give to your database (e.g. dhis2_test).
4) Save and close the hibernate.properties file.
5) Start DHIS2 Live by double-clicking on the file dhis2-live.exe in the DHIS2 Live installation folder or
by using a desktop shortcut or menu link that you might have set up.
6) Wait for the browser window to open and the login screen to show, and then log in with username:
admin and password: district
7) Now you will see a completely empty DHIS2 system and you should start by adding your users,
organisational hierarchy, data elements, and datasets etc. Please refer to the other sections of the
user manual for instructions on how to do this.

Quick intro to designing a DHIS2 database
DHIS2 provides a powerful set of tools for data collection, validation, reporting and analysis, but the
contents of the database, e.g., what to collect, who should collect it and on what format will depend on
the context of use. However, in order to do anything with DHIS2, you must first create meta-data.
Meta-data, or data about the data, describes what should be collected (data elements and categories),
where it should be collected (organisation units) and how frequently it should be collected (periods).
This meta-data needs to be created in the DHIS2 database before it can be used. This can be done
through the user interface and requires no programming or in-depth technical skills of the software, but
does require a good understanding of the processes which you are trying to collect data form.
This section will provide a very quick and brief introduction to DHIS2 database design and mainly
explain the various steps needed to prepare a new DHIS2 system for use. How to do each step is
explained in other chapters, and best practices on design choices will be explained in the
implementers manual. Here are the steps to follow:
1. Set up an organisational hierarchy
2. Define data elements
3. Define data sets and data entry forms
4. Define validation rules
5. Define indicators
6. Define report tables and design reports
7. Set up the GIS module
8. Design charts and customise the dashboard
The organisational hierarchy
The organisational hierarchy defines the organisation using the DHIS2, the health facilities,
administrative areas and other geographical areas used in data collection and data analysis. This 
where dimension to the data is defined as a hierarchy with one root unit (e.g., Ministry of Health) and
any number of levels and nodes below. Each node in this hierarchy is called an organisational unit in
DHIS2.
The design of this hierarchy will determine the geographical units of analysis available to the users as
data is collected and aggregated in this structure. There can only be one organisational hierarchy at
the same time so its structure needs careful consideration. Additional hierarchies (e.g. parallel
695
About demo server, live package and database design Data Elements
administrative groupings such as "Facility ownership") can be modelled using organisational groups
and group sets, however the organisational hierarchy is the main vehicle for data aggregation on the
geographical dimension. Typically national organisational hierarchies in public health have 4-6 levels,
but any number of levels is supported. The hierarchy is built up of parent-child relations, e.g. a Country
or MoH unit (the root) might have e.g. 8 parent units (provinces), and each province again ( at level 2)
might have 10-15 districts as their children. Normally the health facilities will be located at the lowest
level, but they can also be located at higher levels, e.g. national or provincial hospitals, so skewed
organisational trees are supported (e.g. a leaf node can be positioned at level 2 while most other leaf
nodes are at level 5).
Typically there is a geographical hierarchy defined by the health system. e.g. where the administrative
offices are located (e.g. MoH, province, district), but often there are other administrative boundaries in
the country that might or might not be added, depending on how its boundaries will improve data
analysis. When designing the hierarchy the number of children for any organisational unit may indicate
the usefulness of the structure, e.g. having one or more 1-1 relationships between two levels is not
very useful as the values will be the same for the child and the parent level. On the other extreme a
very high number of children in the middle of the hierarchy (e.g. 50 districts in a province) might call for
an extra level to be added in between to increase the usefulness of data analysis. The lowest level,
the health facilities will often have a large number of children (10-60), but for other levels higher up in
the hierarchy approx. 5-20 children is recommended. Too few or too many children might indicate that
a level should be removed or added.
Note that it is quite easy to make changes to the upper levels of the hierarchy at a later stage, the only
problem is changing organisational units that collect data (the leaf nodes), e.g. splitting or merging
health facilities. Aggregation up the hierarchy is done based on the current hierarchy at any time and
will always reflect the most recent changes to the organisational structure. Refer to the chapter on
Organisation Units to learn how to create organisational units and to build up the hierarchy.
Data Elements
The Data Element is perhaps the most important building block of a DHIS2 database. It represents the
what dimension, it explains what is being collected or analysed. In some contexts this is referred to an
indicator, but in DHIS2 we call this unit of collection and analysis a data element. The data element
often represents a count of something, and its name describes what is being counted, e.g. "BCG
doses given" or “Malaria cases”. When data is collected, validated, analysed, reported or presented,
the data elements or expressions built upon data elements describes what the data is. As such the
data elements become important for all aspects of the system and they decide not only how data is
collected, but more importantly how the data values are represented in the database, which again
decides how data can be analysed and presented.
It is possible to add more details to this what dimension through the disaggregation dimension called
data element categories. Some common categories are age and gender, but any category can be
added by the user and linked to specific data elements. The combination of a data element's name
and its assigned category defines the smallest unit of collection and analysis available in the system,
and hence describes the raw data in the database. Aggregations can be done when zooming out of
this dimension, but no further drill-down is possible, so designing data elements and categories define
the detail of the analysis available to the system (on the what dimension). Changes to data elements
and categories at a later stage in the process might be complicated as these will change the meaning
of the data values already captured in the database (if any). So this step is one of the more decisive
and careful steps in the database design process.
One best practice when designing data elements is to think of data elements as a unit of data analysis
and not just as a field in the data collection form. Each data element lives on its own in the database,
completely detached from the collection form, and reports and other outputs are based on data
elements and expressions/formulas composed of data elements and not the data collection forms. So
the data analysis needs should drive the process, and not the look an feel of the data collection forms.
696
About demo server, live package and database design Datasets and data entry forms
A simple rule of thumb is that the name of the data element must be able to stand on its own and
describe the data value also outside the context of its collection form. E.g. a data element name like
"Total referrals" makes sense when looking at it in either the "RCH" form or the "OPD" form, but on its
own it does not uniquely describe the phenomena (who are being referred?), and should in stead be
called "Total referrals from Maternity" or "Total referrals from OPD". Two different data elements with
different meanings, although the field on the paper form might only say "Total referrals" since the user
of the form will always know where these referrals come from. In a database or a repository of data
elements this context is no longer valid and therefore the names of the data elements become so
important in describing the data.
Common properties of data elements can be modelled through what is called data element groups.
The groups are completely flexible in the sense that they are defined by the user, both their names
and their memberships. Groups are useful both for browsing and presenting related data, but can also
be used to aggregate data elements together. Groups are loosely coupled to data elements and not
tied directly to the data values which means they can be modified and added at any point in time
without interfering with the raw data.
Datasets and data entry forms
All data entry in DHIS2 is organised through the use of Datasets. A Dataset is a collection of data
elements grouped together for data collection, and in the case of distributed installs they also define
chunks of data for export and import between instances of DHIS2 (e.g. from a district office local
installation to a national server). Datasets are not linked directly to the data values, only through their
data elements and frequencies, and as such a dataset can be modified, deleted or added at any point
in time without affecting the raw data already captured in the system, but such changes will of course
affect how new data will be collected.
A dataset has a period type which controls the data collection frequency, which can be daily, weekly,
monthly, quarterly, six-monthly, or yearly. Both which data elements to include in the dataset and the
period type is defined by the user, together with a name, short name, and code.
In order to use a dataset to collect data for a specific orgunit you must assign the orgunit to the
dataset, and this mechanism controls which orgunits that can use which datasets, and at the same
time defines the target values for data completeness (e.g. how many health facilities in a district
expected to submit RCH data every month).
A data element can belong to multiple datasets, but this requires careful thinking as it may lead to
overlapping and inconstant data being collected if e.g. the datasets are given different frequencies and
are used by the same orgunits.
Data entry forms
Once you have assigned a dataset to an orgunit that dataset will be made available in Data Entry
(under Services) for the orgunits you have assigned it to and for the valid periods according to the
dataset's period type. A default data entry form will then be shown, which is simply a list of the data
elements belonging to the dataset together with a column for inputting the values. If your dataset
contains data elements with categories such as age groups or gender, then additional columns will be
automatically generated in the default form based on the categories. In addition to the default list-
based data entry form there are two more alternatives, the section-based form and the custom form.
Section forms
Section forms allow for a bit more flexibility when it comes to using tabular forms and are quick and
simple to design. Often your data entry form will need multiple tables with subheadings, and
sometimes you need to disable (grey out) a few fields in the table (e.g. some categories do not apply
to all data elements), both of these functions are supported in section forms. After defining a dataset
697
About demo server, live package and database design Validation rules
you can define it's sections with subsets of data elements, a heading and possible grey fields i the
section's table. The order of sections in a dataset can also be defined. In Data Entry you can now start
using the Section form (should appear automatically when sections are available for the selected
dataset). You can switch between default and section forms in the top right corner of the data entry
screen. Most tabular data entry forms should be possible to do with sections forms, and the more you
can utilise the section forms (or default forms) the easier it is for you. If these two types of forms are
not meeting your requirements then the third option is the completely flexible, although more time-
consuming, custom data entry forms.
Custom Forms
When the form you want to design is too complicated for the default or section forms then your last
option is to use a custom form. This takes more time, but gives you full flexibility in term of the design.
In DHIS2 there is a built in HTML editor (FcK Editor) for the form designer and you can either design
the form in the UI or paste in your HTML directly using the Source window in the editor. In the custom
form you can insert static text or data fields (linked to data elements + category) in any position on the
form and you have complete freedom to design the layout of the form. Once a custom form has been
added to a dataset it will be available in data entry and used automatically. You can switch back to
default and section (if exists) forms in the top right corner of the data entry screen.
Validation rules
Once you have set up the data entry part of the system and started to collect data then there is time to
define data quality checks that help to improve the quality of the data being collected. You can add as
many validation rules as you like and these are composed of left and right side expressions that again
are composed of data elements, with an operator between the two sides. Typical rules are comparing
subtotals to totals of something. E.g. if you have two data elements "HIV tests taken" and "HIV test
result positive" then you know that in the same form (for the same period and organisational unit) the
total number of tests must always be equal or higher than the number of positive tests. These rules
should be absolute rules meaning that they are mathematically correct and not just assumptions or
"most of the time correct". The rules can be run in data entry, after filling each form, or as a more batch
like process on multiple forms at the same time, e.g. for all facilities for the previous reporting month.
The results of the tests will list all violations and the detailed values for each side of the expression
where the violation occurred to make it easy to go back to data entry and correct the values.
Indicators
Indicators represent perhaps the most powerful data analysis feature of the DHIS2. While data
elements represent the raw data (counts) being collected the indicators represent formulas providing
coverage rates, incidence rates, ratios and other formula-based units of analysis. An indicator is made
up of a factor (e.g. 1, 100, 100, 100 000), a numerator and a denominator, the two latter are both
expressions based on one or more data elements. E.g. the indicator "BCG coverage \<1 year" is
defined a formula with a factor 100, a numerator ("BCG doses given to children under 1 year") and a
denominator ("Target population under 1 year"). The indicator "DPT1 to DPT3 drop out rate" is a
formula of 100 % x ("DPT1 doses given"- "DPT3 doses given") / ("DPT1 doses given").
Most report modules in DHIS2 support both data elements and indicators and you can also combine
these in custom reports, but the important difference and strength of indicators versus raw data (data
element's data values) is the ability to compare data across different geographical areas (e.g. highly
populated vs rural areas) as the target population can be used in the denominator.
Indicators can be added, modified and deleted at any point in time without interfering with the data
values in the database.
698
About demo server, live package and database design Report tables and reports
Report tables and reports
Standard reports in DHIS2 are a very flexible way of presenting the data that has been collected. Data
can be aggregated by any organisational unit or orgunit level, by data element, by indicators, as well
as over time (e.g. monthly, quarterly, yearly). The report tables are custom data sources for the
standard reports and can be flexibly defined in the user interface and later accessed in external report
designers such as iReport or through custom HTML reports. These report designs can then be set up
as easily accessible one-click reports with parameters so that the users can run the same reports e.g.
every month when new data is entered, and also be relevant to users at all levels as the organisational
unit can be selected at the time of running the report.
GIS
In the integrated GIS module you can easily display your data on maps, both on polygons (areas) and
as points (health facilities), and either as data elements or indicators. By providing the coordinates of
your organisational units to the system you can quickly get up to speed with this module. See the GIS
section for details on how to get started.
Charts and dashboard
On of the easiest way to display your indicator data is through charts. An easy to use chart dialogue
will guide you through the creation of various types of charts with data on indicators, organisational
units and periods of your choice. These charts can easily be added to one of the four chart sections on
your dashboard and there be made easily available right after log in. Make sure to set the dashboard
module as the start module in user settings.

Working with TextPattern
TextPattern was introduced in DHIS2 version 2.29, as a way of defining a pattern that includes
variables, generated values and raw text, which then could be generated into a text value. The current
use-case for TextPattern is automatically generated attributes for tracked entities, where you want to
generate for example unique ids based on a specific pattern.
This guide will cover both basic and advanced topics for working with TextPattern, but is mainly
focused on how you can define TextPatterns and which limitations and caveats exists.
TextPattern syntax
A TextPattern is a sequence of segments, joined together by the "+" character. A segment has a
specific notation and in most cases a parameter format, which allows for further manipulation of the
value.
TextPattern segments
708
DHIS2 Tutorials TextPattern syntax
Example (segment →
Segment notation Description Paramenter (format)
input value → result)
"Plain text" The plain text segment None "Hello world" → None
will remain unchanged → Hello world 
in all generated values. "Hello \x\x\x" → "Hello
This special segment is you" → Hello you
defined by wrapping
text between two "\d\d\d" → "123" → 123
double quotes. If your
pattern should include
separation symbols like
a dash, you should use
this "-". 
The plain text segment
also allows for
placeholder text. That
means you can specify
that parts of the plain
text segment should be
any of a set of
characters. Currently
there are 4 supported
special characters you
can use:
_ \d (0-9)
_ \x (a-z)
_ \X (A-Z)
_ \w (a-zA-Z0-9)
CURRENT_DATE(form Current date segment Date format CURRENT_DATE(yyyy)
at) will be generated by the → 01-01-2018 → 2018
server at the time of
generation. This is
useful if you want your
patterns to have a time-
constraint that is
disconnected from the
context. You should not
use this if you need to
control which date is
injected into the pattern.
ORG_UNIT_CODE(for This segment Text format ORG_UNIT_CODE(...)
mat) represents the → OSLO → OSL
organisation unit code
associated with the
generation.
709
DHIS2 Tutorials TextPattern syntax
Example (segment →
Segment notation Description Paramenter (format)
input value → result)
RANDOM(format) Random segments will Generation format RANDOM(X####) →
be replaced by a value None → A1234
randomly generated by
the server based on the
format. Generated
segments, like Random,
bases its uniqueness on
the rest of the pattern.
That means a random
value can appear twice,
as long as the rest of
the pattern is different,
which means the
generated text as a
whole will be unique.
SEQUENTIAL(format) Sequential segments Generation format "A"+SEQUENTIAL(###)
will be replaced by a → None → A001 
number, based on a "A"-SEQUENTIAL(###)
counting value on the → None → A002
server. Sequential
segments will start at "B"-SEQUENTIAL(###)
the value 1, and for → None → B001
each generated value
count up until no more "B"-SEQUENTIAL(###)
values are available, → None → B002
based on the format.
Like Random
segments, uniqueness
is based on the rest of
the pattern, so each
possible version of the
pattern will have it's
own sequential counter
starting from 1.
Most segments has a parameter format, except for the plain text segment. The following table lists the
available formats, how they are used and example notations using them.
Parameter formats
Format Description Example
Date format This format is based directly on CURRENT_DATE(dd-MM-yyyy)
the java SimpleDateFormat, → 31-12-2018 
which means any pattern valid for CURRENT_DATE(MM-yyyy) →
SimpleDateFormat, will be valid 12-2018
as a date format in TextPattern
710
DHIS2 Tutorials TextPattern syntax
Format Description Example
Text format The text format allows for some ORG_UNIT_CODE(....) → OSLO
basic text manipulation. Leaving
the format empty will return the ORG_UNIT_CODE(..) → OS
value unmodified, but using "^",
"." and "$", you can modify the ORG_UNIT_CODE(..$) → LO
value before it is returned. Each
"." represents a character, while ORG_UNIT_CODE(^...$) →
"^" represents the start of the text OSLO
and "$" represents the end. When
using formats, the input value ^....$ will require the input value
must be at least the same length to be exactly 4 characters.
as the format.
Generation format The generation format accepts a RANDOM(X###) → A123 
combination of one or more of he RANDOM(****) → 1AbC
following characters: "#", "X", "x"
and "*". They respectively SEQUENTIAL(###) → 001
represent a number(0-9), an
uppercase letter (A-Z), a SEQUENTIAL(######) →
lowercase letter(a-z) or any of the 000001
above(0-9,a-z,A-Z). The
SEQUENTIAL segment only
accepts "#", since it will only
generate numbers. The number
of characters in the format
decides the size of the value
generated. Using just one "#" will
in other words only allow for 10
values (0-9), while "###" will allow
for 1000 values (000-999).
SEQUENTIAL generated values
have leading zeroes, so the
length of the generated value will
always match the format length.
A few important things to note regarding the formats:
• Date format is very versatile, but be aware of which date or time components you are using.
Using components smaller than a day (For example hours or seconds) is not recommended,
even though available.
• Text format allows for marking both the start and end of the input value, but "^..." and "..." will in
reality give exactly the same results. The only time you would want to use "^" is when you want
to enforce the length of the input value. For example, "^....$" will accept OSLO, since its 4
characters between the start and end, but PARIS will be rejected, since it has 5 characters.
• When text format is used for unique values, like organisation unit code, make sure that the
format does not break the uniqueness. (Example: ORG_UNIT_CODE(..) for "PARIS" and
"PANAMA CITY" would both return PA, which means these two organisation units would in
reality share generated values)
• Generation format is the primary way to understanding the capacity of your pattern. Make sure
the format is long enough to cover more values than you need.
711
DHIS2 Tutorials Designing TextPattern for generating ids
To finish off the syntax section of the tutorial, here is a couple of example TextPattern:
ORG_UNIT_CODE(...) + "-" + CURRENT_DATE(yyyyww) + "-" + SEQUENTIAL(#####)
This pattern will have 99999 possible values (based on SEQUENTIAL. 00000 is never used since we
start at 1). In addition, the remaining pattern will change for each different organisation unit generating
values (ORG_UNIT_CODE) and for each week (CURRENT_DATE(yyyyww) represents year and
week). That effectively means every new week, each organisation unit will have 99999 new values
they can use.
"ABC_" + RANDOM(****)
The plain text segment of this pattern, will make no difference in the total capacity of the pattern,
however the generated segment (RANDOM) will allow for 14776336 possible values. The reason for
this is that * can be any one character of the 62 characters available (0-9, a-z, A-Z). You can read
more about understanding pattern capacity further down in the tutorial.
Designing TextPattern for generating ids
One use-case for TextPattern is to generate unique ids. In this section we will present guidelines and
common issues related to designing TextPatterns used for ids.
An id should never contain sensitive information, or information that in combination can identify an
individual. TextPattern does not currently support segments that uses these kind of values, but might
do so in the future.
The following list highlights some of the TextPattern specific restrictions you need to consider when
designing a TextPattern for ids:
• Make sure the capacity (number of possible values) of the TextPattern covers your use-case.
It's better to have more values than needed than less. Tracked entity attributes using
TextPattern will require that a single generated segment is present in the TextPattern.
• A TextPattern is unique in the entire system, but only for the object using it. In other words, if
you have a single tracked entity attribute with TextPattern, used by multiple Tracked entities
(Not to be mistaken for tracked entity instances), all values generated will be shared between
all traced entities using the attribute. This also means that if you have two tracked entity
attributes with the same TextPattern syntax, each attribute will be able to generate the same
value as the other, since uniqueness is based on the attribute.
• SEQUENTIAL segments are in the implementation numbers starting from 1, increasing by 1 for
each value, sequentially until no more values are available. However, in reality you will most
likely end up with gaps when users generate and reserve values that is never used, or if a user
sends in a value where the SEQUENTIAL segment has a higher value than recorded on the
server.
• The current implementation relies on the user-client to send in the values contained in the
TextPattern when storing a new value. That means generating a correct id is depending on the
user, and user-client, to provide the correct data.
Understanding TextPattern capacity
The most important thing to keep in mind when designing a TextPattern, is the capacity - that means
the total number of potential values a TextPattern can yield.
712
DHIS2 Tutorials Understanding TextPattern capacity
With the current implementation of TextPattern, there are three main factors that decides the capacity:
1. Capacity of the generated segment in the TextPattern
2. The presence of a CURRENT_DATE segment
3. The presence of a ORG_UNIT_CODE segment
The presence of a date segment (like CURRENT_DATE) will effectively reset the capacity each time
the segment changes. Depending on the date format, it can change anywhere to yearly to daily. 
Important: If your date format don't contain a year, the pattern will resolve to the same value
every year. That means values will already be used. For example, if your TextPattern looks like this:
CURRENT_DATE(ww) + "-" + RANDOM(#)
This pattern will give you up to 10 unique values for each week, but after 1 year,
CURRENT_DATE(ww) will be the same as last year, and you will have no new values available. If you
use "yyyy-ww" instead, it will be unique for every year, every week.
Organisation unit codes will make your values unique for each different organisation unit, which
means if you have a text pattern like this:
ORG_UNIT_CODE() + "-" + RANDOM(#)
This pattern will give you 10 unique values for each different organisation unit.
Calculating capacity for generated segments
Understanding how to calculate the capacity of a TextPattern is critical when designing TextPatterns.
The generated segments will be the main component of any TextPattern in terms of capacity, then
increased based on the presence of ORG_UNIT_CODE or CURRENT_DATE.
Let's start with SEQUENTIAL segments. Each "#" in the format represents a number between 0 and 9.
To calculate the total capacity, you multiply the number of possible values for each "#". Since it's
always 10 (0-9) the maths is quite straight forward:
SEQUENTIAL(#) = 10 = 10
SEQUENTIAL(###) = 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000
SEQUENTIAL(#####) = 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 100000
Since SEQUENTIAL counters on the server start at 1 and not 0, the actual capacity is 999, but that's
insignificant in most cases.
As soon as we involve RANDOM, the calculation becomes a bit more complicated. Similar to
SEQUENTIAL, a "#" has 10 possible values, in addition we have "X" and "x" with 26 possible values
each, as well as "*" which can be any of the previous, which means 62 (10+26+26) possible values.
To calculate the capacity, you need to take each character in your format and replace with the number
of possible values, then multiply them all together like we did for SEQUENTIAL:
RANDOM(#) = 10 = 10
RANDOM(X) = 26 = 26
RANDOM(*) = 62 = 62
713
DHIS2 Tutorials Random segments and why you should avoid it
RANDOM(X##) = 26 * 10 * 10 = 2600
RANDOM(XXxx) = 26 * 26 * 26 * 26 = 456976
RANDOM(***) = 62 * 62 * 62 = 238328
As you can see, the maths gets a bit more complicated when, but by following this recipe you can see
the number of potential values.
Random segments and why you should avoid it
There is a hidden cost of using the random segment in TextPattern in the long run, but that does not
mean you should never use it. This section will highlight the problems of using the random segment
and suggest when it might be more appropriate to use it.
This section is motivated by an issue with the previous generation strategy, where you only had
random generation. After while, instances using this feature would actually be unable to generate and
reserve new values, since it was taking to long to find available values. This section looks at some of
the problems with random generation that created this situation.
Generating random values
Before using the RANDOM segment in your TextPattern, you should consider the following problems
connected to the use of RANDOM:
• Generating values from a TextPattern with a RANDOM segment will be more complex than
other TextPatterns
Data entry for TextPattern based metadata
As previously mentioned, the only metadata currently supporting TextPattern is the tracked entity
attributes. In this section, we will describe the different ways data entry for TextPattern works,
especially for tracked entity attributes.
Validation of values using TextPattern
By default, all values sent to the server for metadata using TextPattern, will be validated. Validation
can be skipped if needed, but you should always validate input under normal circumstances. The
validation will be based on the TextPattern you have defined and will be as strict as possible:
• Date segments must match the same format as specified in the segment parameter
• Plain text segments must match exactly
• Text segments values must be at least as long as the format string. If both "^" and "$" is
present, the value must match the exact length.
• Generated segment values must match the format exactly, character by character.
When using the server to first generate and reserve values, the server will modify the values used in
the TextPattern before injecting them, meaning you will always get a valid value when generating it on
the server.
A final exception to TextPattern validation is made for a special case: If you change a TextPattern after
reserving values for the original pattern, values sent to the server that are invalid according to the new
TextPattern, will still be accepted if it was already reserved.
714
DHIS2 Tutorials Data entry for TextPattern based metadata
Different data entry flows for TextPattern
There is currently 2 ways a client can store values for TextPattern metadata:
1. Generating and reserving values (Apps should do this for you)
2. Storing a custom value
The preferred way, is to generate and reserve the needed values (The number of values generated
and reserved is handled by the app). That means each time you are seeing and storing a value, it has
been generated and reserved by the server, and will be valid.
The other way might be useful in specific cases. The user will supply the value themselves and as
long as the value supplied is valid for the TextPattern, they can put anything they want. The caveat of
doing it this way, is that you might use values that was reserved by someone else and if you have a
SEQUENTIAL segment, the counter will not be updated.

DHIS2 Frequently Asked Questions Data entry for TextPattern based metadata
DHIS2 Frequently Asked Questions
Q: I have entered data into a data entry form, but I cannot see the data in any reports (pivot tables,
charts, maps). Why does data which is entered not show up immediately in my graphs in DHIS2?
A: Data which is entered into DHIS2 must first be processed with the "analytics". This means that data
is not immediately available in the analytics resources (such as reports, pivot tables, data visualizer,
GIS, etc.) after it has been entered. If scheduling is active, the analytics process will run automatically
at midnight each day. After that, new data which was entered since the last time the analytics process
ran, will become visible.
You can trigger the analytics process manually by selecting Reports->Analytics from the main menu
and pressing the "Start export" button. Note, the process may take a significant amount of time
depending on the amount of data in your database.
Other factors which can affect the visibility of data are:
• Data approval: If data has not been approved to a level which corresponds to your users level,
the data may not be visible to you.
• Sharing of meta-data objects: If certain meta-data objects have not been shared with a user
group which you are a member of, the data may not be visible to you.
• Caching of analytics: In many cases, server administrators cache analytical objects (such as
pivot tables, maps, graphs) on the server. If you have entered data, re-run analytics, and you
are still not seeing any (updated) data, be sure that your data is not being cached by the server.
Q: I have downloaded DHIS2 from https://www.dhis2.org/downloads but when i try to enter the system
it needs a username and password. Which should I use?
A: By default, the username will be "admin" and the password "district". Usernames and passwords
are case sensitive.
