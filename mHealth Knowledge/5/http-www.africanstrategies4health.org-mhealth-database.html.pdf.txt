mHealth	Database
Mobile	health	(mHealth)	is	the	provision	of	health	services	and	information	via	mobile	and	wireless	technologies.	
It	can	be	a	powerful	tool	for	impacting	the	health	​of	Africans.
ASH	produced	six	volumes	of	the	mHealth	Compendium	to	help	USAID	missions,	governments,	and	health	implementing	organizations	access	information	on	a
range	of	mHealth	example	programs.	Profiles	of	the	more	than	150	programs	featured	in	the	Compendium	Series	can	be	accessed	through	the	online	mHealth
Database,	now	available	on	mHealthKnowledge.org.	The	database	allows	users	to	search	case	studies	to	learn	about	the	interventions,	how	they	address	specific
health	areas	or	problems,	important	results	or	evaluation	findings,	and	contact	information	for	their	implementers	and	donors.
The	mHealth	Compendium	Volumes	1-6
