Foreword
While the world’s economy is struggling to recover from the global 
financial crisis, the African economy is in the midst of a long boom. 
Over the past decade GDP has been increasing on average at 5%  
a year, and over the next five years, Africa’s economy will grow faster 
than any other continent. One contributory factor has been the take-
up of information and communications technologies (ICTs) and,  
in particular, the spectacular growth in mobile communications.  
The number of mobile subscriptions in use in Africa increased  
from fewer than 25 million in 2001 to almost 650 million by 2012.  
Two-thirds of African adults now have access to ICTs. The power  
of ICTs is more than just putting mobile phones in the hands of poor 
people. By allowing people to access health information, agricultural 
price data or educational games, ICTs can strengthen other sectors, 
and possibly the whole economy. 
ICTs are now helping Africa to overcome its traditional market failures  
– such as communicable diseases, the public-goods aspects of  
having a literate and numerate population, and clean water and  
sanitation – as well as government failures – absentee teachers  
and doctors, patronage-ridden water and electric utilities, etc.  
Avoiding the excesses of the past, most African governments inter-
vened by providing the regulatory framework and public goods such 
as the backbone for broadband services. The rest is being provided 
by the private sector, which has every interest to capture the profits 
from this private good. In short, they balanced the interventions to 
correct market failures with the avoidance of government failure.

eTransform Africa: The Transformational Use of Information and  
Communication Technologies in Africa captures the existing use 
of ICT in six sectors (agriculture, climate change, education, health,  
financial services, government) and two cross-cutting themes (regional 
trade and integration, ICT competitiveness). It further examines the 
immediate potential that could be realized with further attention by 
both the private and public sectors and makes recommendations  
for policy makers and development practitioners. The detailed studies 
carried out for this report (available at www.eTransformAfrica.org) in-
clude twenty country case studies spanning the continent and an ICT 
data table that showcases country data for mobile and broadband 
indicators. The case studies show how ICTs can help overcome  
government failures in different sectors.
This publication is the result of a collaboration between the African 
Development Bank, the World Bank, the African Union, and various 
authoring teams and their interactions with African entrepreneurs, 
farmers, health workers, and civil servants – all using ICT to make 
better decisions in their economic and social lives. This publication 
not only sheds light on the path Africa is already on, but also encou-
rages continued creative thinking in how to utilize ICTs to benefit 
more Africans.

This report was prepared jointly by the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the World Bank 
(WB), with support from the African Union (AU). The report was edited by a project team led by 
Enock Yonazi (AfDB) and Colin Blackman (Camford Associates), Tim Kelly and Naomi Halewood 
(WB) assisted by Jack Salieu (AfDB) and Elena Gasol Ramos (WB). Tunde Fafunwa (Kitskoo) 
coordinated the work of the consultant teams and Christian Kreutz (WB) created the project 
website (www.eTransformAfrica.org). Overall guidance for the work of the project team was 
provided by Gilbert Mbesherubusa (AfDB), Laurent Besançon, Shanta Devarajan and Philippe 
Dongier (WB) and Moctar Yedaly (AU).
The eTransform Africa study grew out of the African Union Summit of ICT Ministers, held in 
Addis Ababa in January 2010. The eight sectoral and cross-cutting reports were commissioned 
following an international tendering process that attracted some of the best firms and individuals. 
The work programme kicked off with a launch meeting in Nairobi, in February 2011, and continued 
with a review meeting in Johannesburg in June 2011. As the reports and case studies have been 
elaborated, they have been subjected to expert scrutiny both by the project team and by the 
wider public, through the www.eTransformAfrica.org website and other blogs. This philosophy 
of “early exposure” of results has undoubtedly strengthened the final outputs through a rigorous 
process of review and ground-truthing.

Lessons from the sectoral studies
Senegal and uganda. africa is especially vulnerable to the 
impacts of climate change because its major economic 
sectors are more sensitive to climate change and because 
it has lower levels of general economic development. afri-
can countries are preparing for the potential consequenc-
es of climate change by building their understanding of 
climate science, identifying priorities and planning for 
adaptation, and implementing targeted adaptation mea-
sures. Such measures can range from addressing the driv-
ers behind vulnerability and building response capacity, 
to managing climate risk and addressing impacts directly.

such as Drumnet in Kenya, it has been shown to improve 
efficiency by minimizing the duplication, ensuring the 
consistency and improving the integrity of data. 
The Education sector was examined by ict Development 
associates, whose report includes country case studies 
from South africa, uganda and Senegal. it focuses on five 
critical aspects: teacher professional development, digital 
learning resources, affordable technologies, education

by iCts. The means by which educators and students ac-
cess learning materials and collaboration platforms are 
increasingly affordable as more functional, low-cost mo-
bile devices become available. Connectivity is also crucial 
for access ing resources, and requires continued focus on 
competitive broadband access using suitable technologies 
(wired and wireless), and national and regional collab-
orative networks. access to content is improved by open 
educational resources, which can be copied and adapted 
without licence fees. however, effectively integrating 
technology into teaching and learning requires well-qual-
ified educators, a clear focus on equipping teachers with 
iCt literacy skills and support for teachers to use skills 
and technology in teaching and learning.
The Health sector study, carried out by vital Wave Con-
sulting, includes country case studies of ethiopia and Mali. 
health trends in africa are generally positive but there is 
need for significant improvements. The pre-emptive use 
of iCt could act as a “game-changer” in helping to achieve 
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). With the 
impact that mobile-based iCts are already having for con-
sumer communication and transactions, they could be 
further used to enable and simplify consumer and institu-

a tipping point in africa and now is the time for policy 
makers to act boldly. iCts combined with innovative 
business models have helped widen financial inclusion, 
most visibly case in Kenya, where active bank accounts 
have grown fourfold since 2007 aided by some 17 million 
M-PeSa mobile money accounts. Governments have a 
key role to play in encouraging investment and in en-
abling effective regulation, in consultation with Central 
banks and the private sector, including commercial banks 
and mobile money service providers. Governments need 
to coordinate with the regional economic Communities 
(reCs) in support of regional integration by introduc-
ing favourable regulations to allow mobile operators and 
other non-bank third parties to offer cross border mobile 
financial services. 
The issue of Modernizing Government through iCt was 
tackled by Deloitte, with case studies of integrated financial 
management systems in Malawi and electronic tax filing in

a balance is needed between the citizen-facing aspects as 
well as the underlying efficiency and effectiveness of back-
office systems. hence, the delivery tiers of e- and m-Govern-
ment are key but depend on the design, development and 
implementation of underlying iCt systems. Governments 
should recognize the power of social media and exploit it 
to their advantage, in particular to reinforce democratic 
processes, drive efficiency, foster innovation, empower 
public sector workers and expose corruption. establish-

and identity theft, was found to be one of the key building 
blocks for an effective government service delivery.
Finally, a second cross-cutting study on ICT Competitiveness 
was carried out by excelsior with tnO, with country case 
studies of Kenya, Morocco and nigeria. These countries are 
embracing the use of iCts in novel ways to improve the social 
and economic opportunities available to firms and citizens. 
Provided the african iCt market continues its impressive 
double-digit growth, the market could be worth more than 
uS$150 billion by 2016. The study highlights the need to 
build a competitive iCt industry to promote innovation, job 
creation and the export potential of african companies.
Of course, challenges remain. The continent largely lags

Recommendations for policy makers and regulators
ReCoMMendATIon    2.1
Create partnerships with the relevant stakeholders
in many african countries, synergies between the different parties in the agricultural value chain are not exploited opti-
mally. hence, forums need to be set up to encourage dialogue, interaction and promote knowledge related to use of iCt 
in agriculture, such as the World bank’s iCt in agriculture eSourcebook. Specific partnerships should be identified and 
be built between stakeholders for identified eagriculture projects with targeted outcomes, working with established 
partners, such as nePaD or CaaDP. These partnerships can play an invaluable role in the research, planning, problem 
solving, review of operations and in training relevant government officials and staff in the use of iCt in agriculture.
48
ICTs for
AGRICULTURe
in Africa
ReCoMMendATIon    2.2
establish an agricultural hub
leadership, communication and creative thinking are required to initiate and sustain eagriculture projects that will 
have a significant impact. a purpose-built management and support structure would enable communication between 
private sector and government and drive the strategic agenda of the state. Designed to be non-bureaucratic and nimble, 
an agricultural hub would drive agricultural diversification, mega projects including eagriculture projects, and initiate 
and coordinate opportunities in the agricultural sector. These eagriculture projects would in turn stimulate commer-
cialization, diversification and job creation. 
ReCoMMendATIon    2.3
Implement legislation and regulations to govern specific opportunities
legislation and regulations relating to iCts must be revisited, to ensure that, amongst other concerns, information 
security is protected, the cost of communications infrastructure (e.g. broadband) is reduced and iCt infrastructure 
is accessible even from remote rural areas. Some programmes, such as national irrigation schemes and traceability 
programmes, may require new, strong legislation and regulation. national legislative bodies together with Ministries of 
agriculture and Ministries of Communications need to coordinate to ensure timely enactment of laws and regulations. 
ReCoMMendATIon    2.4
Consider adoption of traceability systems at a national level
traceability systems have the potential to bring about an observable improvement in the well-being of large numbers of 
people on the african continent as export markets can be created when traceability systems are implemented correctly. 
Systems should address full traceability, from first contact to market destination, since systems that do not cover the 
whole lifecycle create gaps in traceability, which may be detrimental to the industry and the consumer. it is essential 
that legislation and regulations are enforced and will also apply to other agricultural products. 
ReCoMMendATIon    2.5
empower women in agriculture
in africa, women perform 65 per cent of all activities within the agricultural sector. not only do these women often 
have little access to finance, but also they have little free time to devote to their own interests or to rest and are physi-
cally at a disadvantage. Women in rural communities, and particularly those moving from subsistence farming to 
small-scale farming, can benefit greatly from iCt as these can save time and physical effort and equal access can be 
monitored. Governments need to provide incentives to telecommunications service providers to expand money trans-
fer services to rural communities as these enable rural woman to have more autonomy over their finances. Content 
providers need to provide health, nutrition and educational advice on eagriculture web pages. active monitoring of 
eagriculture programmes by government is necessary to assess the degree to which these programmes take the inter-
ests of women into account.

iCt can be used to reduce water consumption significantly using modern irrigation techniques and as a result enhance 
the quality and productivity of land and eventually increase farmers’ incomes. Since technology that has been used for 
a number of years in egypt with great success may still be deemed as “new” in many other african countries, consulting 
with and learning from experts and those with extensive experience in iCt is recommended.
ReCoMMendATIon    2.7
Implement integrated eAgriculture plans
implementation of a comprehensive, integrated, long-term eagriculture Plan for each country should involve all stake-
holders and hence increase stakeholder ownership, bring about economies of scale, and ensure that there is political 
and executive commitment to eagriculture with the necessary budgetary allocation. The plans facilitate the design of 
single technology frameworks for each country into which new hardware and software components, addressing differ-
ent functionality and features, could slot. Single-window services and one-stop-shops naturally result from such plans. 
There is also a need to strengthen african research and training institutes in the agricultural and environmental field, 
including those that play a role in monitoring climate change.
Recommendations for donors
ReCoMMendATIon    2.8
develop self-sustaining funding solutions
Since eagriculture ventures, particularly those taken up by communities, must be sustainable beyond their initial 
funding periods, it is necessary that strong business models exist and that the community members can benefit directly. 
Some jobs related to eagriculture can be filled by local people and creating these jobs would address the rural brain 
drain to some small extent. Donors should publish the fact that a description of viable plans for ultimately making a 
project self-funding is one of their funding application’s evaluation criteria. 
ReCoMMendATIon    2.9
Focus on community ownership
Well-established community ownership assists projects to survive after donors move on and reduces long-term depen-
dency on an external champion. Thus, programme designers and implementers of community-based projects should 
include community members in decision making early in the project and progressively hand over leadership and op-
eration of the project to them. as community owned projects are often resource-scarce, it is best to adopt approaches 
that make adequate use of the existing infrastructure. 
50
ReCoMMendATIon    2.10
Make eAgriculture technology robust and accessible
Systems are only valuable if they are used, but this can only occur in eagriculture projects if the end users find the 
systems easy to use and the technology is cheap, available, reliable and can be run off-line when necessary. backup and 
disaster recovery plans, as well as alternative work processes that can easily be linked into the primary system, need 
to be implemented so that systems are useable even if there is some failure of the technology. Systems designers and 
developers need to design system access through commonly available technology devices, such as mobile devices, and 
include alternative communication options in order to include the largest possible number of end users. voice is often 
a better option than text because users are often not fully literate. Multi-purpose telecentres not only allow internet 
and iCt access but are important centres for learning, listening and stimulating ideas. initial donor financial support 
is needed until the number of users reaches a critical mass.
ReCoMMendATIon    2.11
Build human capacity in rural communities
rural communities urgently need basic education opportunities, including basic farming skills and business manage-
ment skills. Complete reliance on eeducation is not recommended in communities made up primarily of smallholders 
or subsistence farmers but the internet can be a very valuable resource for the teachers who provide classroom tuition. 
Donors and funders are urged to ask for an educational use component to be made a funding eligibility requirement 
for all projects. a good model here is the african leadership in iCt (aliCt) component of the Global eSchools and 
Communities initiative (GeSCi), based in nairobi, Kenya. 
ReCoMMendATIon    2.12
encourage environmental responsibility through country agriculture strategy maps
Country specific agriculture strategy maps, using a variety of iCt tools but primarily imaging tools such as GiS and 
satellite technologies, can be used to encourage environmentally responsible farming as well as commercially astute 
practices. Donors are urged to assist in developing the eagriculture plan recommended to policy makers and regula-
tors in recommendation 2.7 above by providing access to the necessary technology and international experts required 
for developing country specific agriculture strategy maps.

Recommendations for government and development partners
ReCoMMendATIon    3.1
Use a systematic framework to structure thinking
a systematic framework, such as that illustrated in Figure 3.1, is fundamental to structuring the approach to the role of 
iCts in adapting to climate change. Such a framework should focus on: 
• reducing vulnerability, such as on iCts that contribute to improvements in health, food, nutrition and other social 
drivers of vulnerability; and 
• building adaptive capacity, such as on iCt-enabled interventions in the water and agriculture sectors, on weather 
prospects and water hazards, land management and adaptive capacity of farmers and pastoralists. 
in addressing direct impacts of climate change, the framework should focus on:
• developing climate change projections at national, regional and sectoral levels; and 
• programme and project interventions in urban planning; coastal and water resources management, the establish-
ment and management of early warning systems, and the delivery of disaster and emergency relief.

ReCoMMendATIon    3.2
Build capacity for integrating ICTs into national strategic adaptation plans
building the capacity for integrating iCts into adaptation policy development will have significant benefits. Particular 
attention should be paid to including more detailed application of iCts in national adaptation Plans in lDCs and 
adaptation planning efforts in other countries. traditional bureaucratic “silos” separate environment, climate change 
and adaptation policy makers and planners from those working on iCts and telecommunications. Planned inter-
ventions should be undertaken to bring those responsible for adaptation policy and planning (particularly national 
adaptation Plans) together with iCt/telecommunications government staff to work together for more effective plan-
ning and implementation.
ReCoMMendATIon    3.3
Involve the private sector more extensively in planning and implementation
engagement of the iCt private sector in climate change adaptation is less substantial and widespread than it is in 
mitigation, where the private sector is directly involved in developing clean technologies, energy efficiency, demateri-
alization to reduce carbon footprints and other areas of innovation. More work is needed to engage strategically with 
the private iCt sector, to review where privately motivated interests in applications could directly or serendipitously 
enhance adaptation while also delivering commercial value. 
Recommendations for governments and donors
ReCoMMendATIon    3.4
embed ICT planning in the adaptation planning process
use of iCts should be embedded in the adaptation planning processes that are already underway in most african 
countries. in particular, for the lDCs, the preparation of second generation national adaptation Plans should be 
seen as a window of opportunity for the inclusion of iCt-relevant interventions. Preparation for these should in-
clude a capacity building programme to review where and how investments in iCts might be best integrated within 
these plans.
ReCoMMendATIon    3.5
develop open data policies across Africa
access to data is a fundamental requirement for adaptation planning. Model policy frameworks and guidance could 
be developed for countries across africa, with a view to making environmental and meteorological data open to all 
interests (public, academic, and private).
67
ReCoMMendATIon    3.6
Invest in tools and infrastructure
There is considerable scope to invest in tools and infrastructure that will have a direct impact on knowledge of current 
and projected climate change impacts. These include: 
• early warning systems, weather management, meteorological systems, satellite and remote sensing systems; 
• smart systems and sensor networks;
• geographic information systems/modelling/planning and decision-making tools; 
• knowledge management systems, information sharing systems, planning and decision-making tools; and 
• mobile phone applications and GPrS. 
ReCoMMendATIon    3.7
support for the sharing of knowledge and action for adaptation
adaptation policy makers and planners need to be able to connect with and learn from one another about what is 
working and what is not – and this knowledge exchange needs to be informed by real experience on the ground. 
two major gaps need to be addressed:
• mechanisms for sharing information between platforms, and for meta-level search-and-retrieval access across all 
platforms; and
• mechanisms for managing, sharing and developing flows of communication with vulnerable communities.
The potential for using crowd-sourcing techniques to address these gaps should be explored, particularly those that are 
enabled by mobile phones, to generate real-time data on both acute and chronic impacts of climate change.

Promote data-driven decision-making at all levels. The focus on data usage at all levels implies that investment in future 
eMiS development should focus on schools, colleges and universities that provide the data.  
ReCoMMendATIon    4.4
Harness digital learning resources
Consider judicious investments in content creation and aggregation to ensure compliance with african curricula and/or local lan-
guage demands, motivating usage by educators and students. in the first instance, priority content could be derived from open 
content sources. if suitable content is not available, it will be useful to identify and invest in priority content development focus areas.

For development partners
Development partners are potential sources of funding guidance and expertise. They are especially well posi-
for initiatives which cannot be readily financed from tioned to stimulate and support initiatives that are based 
national budgets, as well as potential sources of policy on cross-border collaboration:
ReCoMMendATIon    4.6
ensure funded projects contribute to national policies and objectives
Often, iCt in education projects initiated by development partners have not been clearly aligned to broader national 
policies and objectives. Where this has been the case, such projects tend to be unsustainable and may even impede 
progress in effective roll-out of iCt in education by creating conflicts of interest and unnecessary fragmentation. 
ReCoMMendATIon    4.7
Consider investment in the enabling policy environment
Should national strategy be unclear, development partners should consider support for governments to develop the 
policy environment, including expert support, financing and capacity building at both national and regional levels.
ReCoMMendATIon    4.8
Consider investments to build capacity at a regional or continental level
regional or continental initiatives can contribute to building capacity that would support policy makers in 
implementing the kinds of initiatives outlined in this chapter. These might include:
1. development of common, openly licensed course and programme materials; 
2. support for the aggregation and release under open licences of digital learning resources produced in african 
countries, possibly by supporting regional consortia of providers; 
3. establishment of platforms for capacity building and knowledge exchange on eMiS deployment; 
4. support for the development of nrens and deployment of associated data networks and applications (e.g. grid-
computing, video-conferencing, e-learning, etc); and 
5. development of the capacity of policy makers and regulators to enable them to establish more effective iCt in educa-
tion policies, strategies and regulatory frameworks.
82
ReCoMMendATIon    4.9
Continue to fund pilot projects to test innovative technologies
technology is still developing rapidly bringing with it new educational opportunities. experimentation is important, 
therefore, to test the potential educational applicability of these new technologies and approaches, examine their total 
cost of ownership and establish their strengths and weaknesses. Often, it is difficult for governments to fund such ex-
perimentation, but it remains an essential part of building a knowledge base of best practice. Development partners 
have a critical role to play in supporting such activities, not least in ensuring pilot projects are well evaluated and the 
results widely shared.
ReCoMMendATIon    4.10
ensure that intellectual capital generated by funded projects is shared
adopting policies that lead to release of intellectual capital under open licences (unless there are valid reasons not to 
do so) and ensuring that this is stored in a sustainable online repository would help significantly to reduce wastage and 
duplication of investment. 
ReCoMMendATIon    4.11
Undertake an evaluation and impact assessment of regional initiatives
investments by donors, and national governments, in this crucial field will be much more productive if they are rooted 
in independent critical evaluation of regional initiatives at different stages of development and implementation. This 
will provide better understanding of which initiatives to support and how these can be best supported, reinforced or 
expanded where appropriate, including support for collaboration between regional initiatives so that they reinforce 
one another.

Recommendations for policy makers
ReCoMMendATIon    5.1
Commit to financial inclusion through mobile banking
Commitment to poverty reduction and development on a national level form the basis of a commitment to financial inclu-
sion. Policies and regulations should encourage market entry (e.g. permit mobile operators to accept deposits on behalf of 
licensed financial institutions where depositors could earn interest) and prevent monopolies (e.g. disallow exclusive agree-
ments for cash in/out points). experimentation should be encouraged by easing procedures for testing new approaches. 
interoperability should be encouraged by developing data and process standards specific to new areas of financial services, 
such as mobile financial services. Scaling states should coordinate awareness-raising with third-party organizations with 
target markets (e.g. agribusiness, healthcare). The more advanced states should consider introducing a real-time mobile 
transaction clearing/settlement switch in order to remove the bottleneck when shifting to an open network.
ReCoMMendATIon    5.2
support diversification in mobile financial services
Generic single products or constricted services leave latent and explicit demands unmet or even discourage uptake 
and participation. Socio-economic conditions specific to a country’s environment should be taken into account in the 
kinds of products offered (e.g. islamic finance), rather than regulations determining the choices offered to consumers. 
Cash-in/cash-out, bill payments, deposits, savings, remittances, insurance, provident funds, and loans are examples of 
products that can be offered, and national policies should provide incentives to institutions and agents to offer these 
and other diversified services.

ReCoMMendATIon    5.3
encourage access to capital for sMes
Promoting growth and fostering SMe success requires transformative policies that pay particular attention to the 
ripple effects that SMe capital access has on the overall economy. These effects include increased employment, asset 
building and more tax revenue. Governments should help to lower the fear of risk among bankers by providing mea-
sured loan guarantees, similar to the Small business administration in the united States. Such programmes can also be 
complemented by making training available to SMes in financial management, innovation and marketing.
ReCoMMendATIon    5.4
Promote appropriate and flexible identification policies
absence of, or limited proximity to, financial institutions is not the only barrier that keeps poor customers from ac-
cessing financial services. identification flexibility for small transactions is a crucial policy component that should be 
seriously considered. incentives aimed at making services widely available should come before mandates to obtain 
identity documents such as a national iD, driving licence, proof of residence, or passport. national identification 
initiatives should be undertaken that use low-cost services to register and identify users, with feasibility studies of 
biometric options. Citizen participation in identification enrolment should be encouraged through a mix of incen-
tives and requirements, e.g. by pairing with useful services (G2P payments and advertising), or by requiring linking 
to activation of SiMs. risk-based methods of identification should be used for establishing new financial accounts 
so that risks may be mitigated by limiting balance and transfer amounts and providing increasing capabilities with 
greater evidence of identity.
ReCoMMendATIon    5.5
Provide guidance for streamlining back-end systems
Detailed guidelines rather than mandatory rules would be most helpful to streamline the back-end systems that 
should be installed and managed across institutions. a banking technology coordinating group within central banks, 
ministries of finance/development, or independently operating offices could assess and audit technologies that enable 
financial inclusion. Such a body could monitor and outline the latest and most strategically relevant back-end systems, 
including mobile banking components, and interface with technologies used by different institutions. 
ReCoMMendATIon    5.6
develop data standards and practices for credit data
Policies should aim to address the problems presented by fragmented, standalone or non-existent credit bureaus that 
complicate lending for institutions as well as beneficiaries. a database system should be established to provide trans-
parency for both lenders and borrowers. Data standards and practices should be developed for generating and ag-
gregating credit data. alternative forms of data for discerning credit-worthiness should be examined. an obligation 
should be considered for national utilities to make payment data available to credit bureau services.
95
Recommendations for donors
ReCoMMendATIon    5.7
Reduce private sector risks by underwriting “first movers”
Donors have an important role to play in underwriting the risks of first movers thereby encouraging private sector 
involvement and innovation. For instance, private sector involvement could be induced through goal-oriented awards 
for early and successful efforts to address inclusion goals through the availability of mobile banking (Gates Foundation 
incentive fund for haiti is an example). incubator efforts for product designs and concepts tailored to consumer needs 
should be supported.
ReCoMMendATIon    5.8
Reduce shared costs by underwriting common supporting systems
The selection of back-end systems log-ically falls to the private sector, since it affects competitive positioning and costs 
considerations. however, donors might consider underwriting a “minimum-feature” service available via the cloud so 
that even the smallest MFis and banks would be able to manage accounts. Donors would also make a positive impact 
by supporting the systems necessary for interconnection (real-time switches for mobile payment interoperability) and 
systems that pre-condition infrastructure for service delivery (identification registries). Such investments work with 
rather than against the private sector, enabling more market participation. 
ReCoMMendATIon    5.9
Leverage limited resources to drive private and consumer action
Donors have an essential role in reducing the risks of lending to small, unknown businesses. loan guarantee pro-
grammes are an important part of small business support efforts and donor funds could be leveraged for this purpose. 
in areas where traditional credit bureaus are failing to serve SMes (or do not exist), donors could also support alterna-
tive methods for assessing and sharing risks. Such scenarios might include leveraging crowd-based voting mechanics 
combined with donor-to-peer (Kiva.org) and peer-to-peer (Prosper.com) lending models to determine donor alloca-
tion of funds. Donors should support efforts to raise consumer awareness, and back solution incubators and heavy 
experimentation to translate needs into products.

Recommendations for policy makers, regulators, administrators 
and project managers
The recommendations listed below will help those who • implement interventions that produce measurable results.
participate in and influence the delivery of iCt-based 
health solutions in africa to: • evaluate the impact and cost-efficiency of iCt solu-
tions before going to scale.
• Design appropriate and sustainable iCt solutions for 
health systems strengthening efforts. • Develop fast-track options for multi-country collaborations.
ReCoMMendATIon    6.1
Create specific and scalable architecture
a scalable architecture should be established to assure an ehealth system can expand to meet new capacity require-
ments, adapt to social or political changes and continue to function despite financial limitations. One useful reference 
model is the mhealth alliance’s enterprise architecture initiative (see box 6.3), coordinating all stakeholders, including 
108

consumers, administrators, application developers, vendors, policy makers, regulators, civil society and funders. 
System rules provide boundaries that govern stakeholders’ use of health systems and the platforms on which they are 
managed, allowing developers, in particular, to create appropriate applications. another example of an ehealth ecosys-
tem becoming more common in africa is ongoing in Sierra leone.
With a multi-phased approach to target specific segments of the healthcare community, administrators can consider 
the needs, situation and infrastructure of the country to optimize intervention and cost. it is important to aim for 
simple, low-cost interventions before attempting more complex system-based interventions that interact with other 
health technology initiatives. The more iCt is a part of the healthcare worker’s daily engagement, the more likely 
ehealth interventions will become accepted as the norm.

Precede ICT interventions with needs assessments
before large-scale investments in ehealth are undertaken, policy makers should commission a comprehensive needs 
assessment to provide an up-to-date, objective view of the health and intervention needs of the population and of 
health workers. an additional situational analysis can also provide an examination of the resources available to sup-
port iCt-based interventions, including physical infrastructure, human capacity and telecommunications networks. 
Similarly, an infrastructure asset assessment will ensure that ehealth strategies and interventions properly leverage 
existing and available infrastructure, and that policy makers map evidence-based interventions.
ReCoMMendATIon    6.3
Create fora to unite decision-makers
national governments should facilitate cross-sector dialogue and cooperation by creating forums in which public and 
private-sector decision makers can collaboratively determine priorities and identify available assets, reducing fragmen-
tation and accelerating the potential for scale. a well-executed forum allows diverse stakeholders to share best practices 
and capitalize on economies of scale, even through regional collaborations. regional economic Communities (reCs), 
supported by the african union, World bank, international Finance Corporation (iFC) and african Development 
bank, could also play a role in bringing decision makers together.
One example of this type of forum is “Connect africa”, a working group convened by the african union and interna-
tional telecommunication union, in partnership with the World bank, governments of donor countries, and govern-
ments of participating african countries. launched in October 2007 with uSD $55 billion pledged at that time, the 
initiative is designed to mobilize all resources needed to bridge iCt infrastructure gaps across africa. in such a regional 
forum, economies of scale can easily be derived; for example, the success of uniCeF’s rollout of rapidSMS to improve 
supply chain management during the famine in ethiopia could be replicated in similar situations in other countries, 
such as Somalia.
ReCoMMendATIon    6.4
Create incentives for partnership and foster cross-sector collaboration
Development of iCt-based solutions tends to be “siloed”, within a vertical sectors, yet the multi-faceted nature of 
ehealth requires the skills and resources of multiple sectors. national policy makers can facilitate multi-sector partner-
ships that include the private sector, universities and other research and development organizations. Public-private 
partnerships can encourage corporate fiscal discipline and deep understanding of consumer needs.
Creating a cross-sector digital platform with potential use across health, financial services, agriculture, public services 
and education could accelerate the scaling and sustainability of iCt-based interventions by increasing economies of 
scale and return on investment. This is particularly important in african countries that are small markets, where sector- 
specific platforms may not be viable given their relatively small user or customer base. in some countries, mobile plat-
forms that offer services in other sectors, such as mobile money transfer, may provide a base on which health services 
can be added.
110
ReCoMMendATIon    6.5
Create national Id systems to facilitate impact measurements
health records linked to uniquely identifiable individuals are a key pillar of successful ehealth strategies, because of 
their potential to improve continuity of care, enable point-of-service devices, and feed nationwide health information 
systems. The creation of unique identifiers that can form the basis of individual, digitized health records is a strong first 
step. These unique iDs are also extremely useful for targeting social protection systems. 
Further, the lack of measurable, longitudinal data is one of the biggest barriers to ehealth investment because it pre-
vents the ability to measure the impact of the solutions and justify the investment in these interventions. after enabling 
national unique iD systems, governments should take a more active role in conducting rigorous impact studies through 
robust monitoring and evaluation programmes, or through engaging universities and nGOs as research partners.
ReCoMMendATIon    6.6
Conduct a total cost of ownership analysis
a common reason for the inability of ehealth interventions to scale or sustain themselves is the failure by planners to 
consider all of the financial costs associated with such programmes, and the comparative cost effectiveness with non-
iCt solutions. technology costs, especially hardware, often comprise an entire budget with inadequate attention given 
to training, support, maintenance and operating costs. Conducting a rigorous total cost of ownership study can prevent 
unforeseen costs from damaging projects’ chances for success, and can also force planners and partners to consider all 
of the elements they will need to plan for and how each of them will be funded.
Recommendations for donors
Though policy makers play the central role in setting a • Design a course of action to include iCt in planning

to help donors and other health sector investors to: iCts while the private sector is primarily a lead provider.
ReCoMMendATIon    6.7
Incentivize policy makers to follow system rules
Donors should encourage countries to adopt policies within a set of architectures that enable developers and vendors 
to provide the best services and applications at the most affordable prices. Donors could, for example, create or add 
to project checklists the desired systems characteristics (i.e. interoperable, scalable, sustainable, multi-layered, and 
supported by a private-public partnership) that must be present before donors fund projects. Countries that fulfil the 
conditions listed on the checklists would then benefit from a fast-track status on applications.
111
ReCoMMendATIon    6.8
establish cooperation within and between donor agencies
Donors should use iCt to establish standards among themselves – regarding nomenclature, metrics and databases. 
They can use iCt to automatically cross-reference one another’s research, pre-empt disagreements and promote col-
laboration, thereby reducing overall system costs, minimizing duplication and increasing the benefit of each of their 
efforts. iCt systems that are built only to support an individual donor’s programmes, especially in disease-specific 
projects, are often cited as a major reason for the fragmentation of the ehealth landscape. Donors can do their part to 
improve this situation by coordinating their technology funding initiatives and seeking alignment with each other on 
common standards, as well as by adhering to the “rules” established by national governments.
Within their respective institutions, donors should archive and make available impact assessments for all projects, 
and reward projects that provide useful assessments like impact analyses and standardized return on investment cal-
culations. Such standardization should encourage policy makers, administrators and project designers to actively and 
consciously integrate measurement and evaluation into their ehealth strategies.
ReCoMMendATIon    6.9
Reward cross-sector and PPP efforts in eHealth systems development
Donors should encourage and reward countries that demonstrate a commitment to maximizing iCt for cross-sector 
and public-private partnership (PPP) and collaborations. Such a position among donors will encourage meaningful 
dialogue, interaction and collaboration between such agencies and ministries of health, technology and education 
with more revenue-driving ministries such as communication and finance. Donors should make cooperation within 
government, and involvement of other relevant sectors, a pre-requisite for financial or technical assistance.

Recommendations to policy makers and regulators
ReCoMMendATIon    7.1
develop new organizational and legal support structures
individual countries should develop over-arching national eGovernment plans that look at the public service of 
the country as a whole. by integrating existing systems, agencies can share information and communicate quickly, 
easily and frequently and access and participation by the citizens can be facilitated. a complete legal framework 
for iCt-enabled service delivery should address aspects such as cybercrime and misuse, electronic signatures and 
data protection. awareness campaigns need to drive home the message among communities that payment over 
electronic channels is safe and that the data they share with governments is confidential and will not be used to 
their detriment.

ReCoMMendATIon    7.2
eastablish national identification systems
accurate, effective and efficient national identification systems, incorporating technology that reduces fraud and iden-
tity theft (e.g. biometric technologies that complement textual information), mean that people can be identified even 
without having a document at hand. Cost, including the cost of reaching citizens in remote areas and issuing national 
identification cards, privacy, risk of disenfranchisement and other civil rights issues need careful attention. technology 
is necessary but by no means sufficient for a successful outcome. 
ReCoMMendATIon    7.3
Address socio-economic and digital divides 
The digital divide in african countries is wide. Without access to iCt-related infrastructure the poor cannot easily 
benefit from other eGovernment initiatives. Those in rural communities, the poor and women are least likely to have 
access to technology. however, access via mobile phones can remedy the problem to some extent and connectivity 
can be addressed by exploiting mobile phone networks. a second strategy is building and equipping internet-enabled 
community information centres.
ReCoMMendATIon    7.4
Recognize the power of social media
Public agencies should exploit social media to their advantage. Governments can use social media as a platform to 
enhance transparency, exchange ideas and invite comments on government policies, handle crises, and build political 
opinion among the masses.
ReCoMMendATIon    7.5
exploit economies of scale
Projects should be identified that have the greatest potential impact, that can provide benefits simultaneously to more 
than one large group of stakeholders, and that have the potential for quickly recovering development costs. economies 
of scale and scope can also be brought about by intra-public sector collaboration, leading to better cost-benefit factors 
in at least the following ways:
• a unified data centre with adequate disaster recovery to host applications for all agencies
• a government-wide iCt network with high availability and adequate redundancy 
• Common citizen helpdesks for trouble-shooting and general assistance
• Shared information systems (e.g. human resources management systems, financial management systems, and inven-
tory and asset management systems) 
• Sharing the same service delivery infrastructure through citizen service centres.
126
Recommendations to the donor community
ReCoMMendATIon    7.6
support citizen-centric initiatives with social media 
learn from existing initiatives. This could be notably applicable in countries with upcoming elections, particularly where previous 
elections have been tainted by allegations of corruption, suppression of information or intimidation. ensure that legislation and 
institutional requirements imposed by government do not restrict adoption and use of Web 2.0 and social media technologies.
ReCoMMendATIon    7.7
Pilot cloud computing in independent election monitoring
Funding will be needed for pilot projects that could serve as a proof of concept for the use of cloud computing in election monitoring.
ReCoMMendATIon    7.8
establish technology platforms for anonymous whistle-blowing
Pilot a technology system using anonymous web communication and other technologies to completely hide the iden-
tity of whistle blowers who expose corruption in the public sector.
ReCoMMendATIon    7.9
Create incubation spaces for innovative technical solutions
Create incubation spaces for collaboration and innovation for applications in the public service sector. Cloud comput-
ing can assist sites in sharing data and software, hence only occasional face-to-face meetings are required.
ReCoMMendATIon    7.10
support capacity building programmes for open data projects
replicate open data capacity building projects for transparency and accountability. 
ReCoMMendATIon    7.11
empower public sector workers in rural areas
reduce administrative burden on workers. This could be achieved through the reduction of paperwork through the 
development of mobile applications to replace paper-based solutions.

9.5 ReCoMMendATIons
Despite the successes and the roadblocks, there are develop to sustain and further grow the iCt sector. These 
specific, proven interventions that african nations can recommendations include:
ReCoMMendATIon    9.1
Reduce the cost of access for mobile and broadband
addressing the direct cost challenges will require improving the regulatory and competitive environments for opera-
tors as well as better coordination in developing the infrastructure. There will be some negative near-term effects on 
the largest or incumbent players, since many of these interventions encourage increased competition. however, the 
improvement of the long-term outlook for the iCt sector should benefit operators by expanding the customer and 
business base for these services.
One method is to encourage nimble billing approaches to lower end-user costs and drive up usage. interventions may 
include allowing for longer periods of validity for pre-paid credit, enabling per second billing, nation-wide tariffs, low 
denomination recharges, and enabling discounts for “friends and family” networks.
regulators will have to own most of these initiatives. The nature of the underlying barriers is business competition and 
product design. That said, there is a potential role for donors to provide limited subsidies to jump start iCt usage in 
countries with high retail access costs.
ReCoMMendATIon    9.2
support government/private-sector collaboration
While government and the private sector may not agree on all issues, it is important that the two have an ongoing, 
structured dialogue. in order to ensure this, the first task would be to create a vehicle and the expectation for interac-
tion between the two groups. The Kenya iCt board is an example of this. established five years ago to be the imple-
mentation arm for iCt policy in Kenya, this board has played the role of mediator between the government and private 
sector and, more importantly, advocate for the sector and its advancement. 
areas where such partnerships can create success include jointly develop and manage infrastructure projects, e.g. large 
broadband projects like eaSSy and SeaCOM. Governments can also spotlight private sectors on joint priorities to 
engage and attract donors and MnCs to promote the local bPO industry.

ReCoMMendATIon    9.3
Improve the eCommerce environment
Governments, the private sector and donors all play a role in improving the eCommerce environment. all three can 
set an example by themselves embracing eCommerce in their own operations, by engaging in online (mobile) procure-
ment practices and creating incentives for companies to go online. Other methods include launching communication 
campaigns to promote eCommerce, adopt model eContracting/transactions and eSignature legislation for a region, 
develop data and electronic security laws to include data protection and develop online consumer/supplier protection 
laws including iP sections.
ReCoMMendATIon    9.4
Improve ICT worker skill levels
african countries need to continue to invest strongly in education as the complexity and competition for vendors in 
the arena is increasing. human capital is a weakness for most african countries and bPO success is largely predicated 
on reliable talent. Owing to intense global competition in virtually every segment of the bPO value chain, african 
countries need to delineate exactly where they would like to participate (medical transcription, coding, billing), build 
up relevant experience in these niche areas, and improve infrastructure to execute seamlessly.
Methods to develop skills amongst the local population include supporting broad primary and secondary education 
efforts, customizing tertiary schooling efforts to reflect greater context of business and supporting technical skills de-
velopment through incubators and the private sector. For example, Kenya, nigeria, South africa and uganda have all 
established networks and academies to advance bPO skills and capabilities, including bPO certifications supporting 
global standards. nigeria has established the bPO academy and the association of Outsourcing Practitioners of nigeria. 
in uganda, the School of uganda’s Makerere university, a leading computing school in east africa, has collaborated 
with Orion Outsource World and the african bPO academy to offer a training programme focused on skills to work 
for global bPO firms and ultimately qualify students for the bPO Certification institute’s (bCi) globally accredited 
certification. The programme is currently aiming to train 3,000 young ugandans. Donors can provide both technical 
and financial support to design and implement these initiatives.
ReCoMMendATIon    9.5
encourage innovative business models that drive employment, such as microwork
Microwork represents the promise of iCt as an enabler of broad economic impact. This is possible due to the disag-
gregation of complex problems into work products that can be addressed by a variety of skill levels and the ability to 
leverage the relatively well-distributed mobile phone as a work interface. 
tactics to encourage microwork can be divided into both the demand side and the Supply-side. Demand side tactics 
include expanding the number of business issues that can be addressed through microwork, creating a marketplace for 
retail/individuals for microwork-related solutions, and creating an internal demand for microwork from local african 
governments or large corporations. Supply side tactics include addressing the standard basket of iCt SMe challenges 
(e.g. technical skills of the microworker), as many of the issues will be similar for the microworker, creating standards 
on workflow management to allow for interchangeability between the various players in the value chain, and creating 
voice-enabled interfaces to expand the labour pool of microworkers. The standard setting exercise would be a particu-
larly critical area for donor involvement, as the standards would need to be continent-wide, if not world-wide, to drive 
transformative business impact and visibility for this sector.
157
likewise, the bPO opportunity is large but highly competitive. even operating in the right business environment and 
maintaining strong bPO fundamentals, there are industry pitfalls that need to be avoided for african bPO companies 
to survive. an example of a pitfall is bPO firms locking in long-term unprofitable deals in a reaction to the intense 
competition, thereby dooming the partnership to ultimately fail. The large amount of upfront cash investment required 
for large bPO deals often causes vendors to increase capacity very quickly, putting them into a situation with excess 
capacity. although these pitfalls are substantial, there are enough methods and experience in the marketplace so that 
with the right due diligence a firm can avoid them. There may be a role for the donor community to disseminate these 
business decision best practices to bPO players on the continent.
ReCoMMendATIon    9.6
Create ICT parks in countries that meet infrastructure requirements
The development of the iCt sector has been proven to contribute heavily to the growth of a nation’s GDP and, there-
fore, expanding that investment in developing countries in africa would be a strong initiative for the continent and 
its future growth. not all countries, however, are poised to successfully implement, operate and sustain an iCt park. 
however, there are common success factors across the most successful parks from which countries can learn as they 
determine their own viability to establish a park. 
Some of these success factors include park organizers having very clear and concise plans to address and mitigate the 
critical barriers of lack of sponsorship, availability of skilled labour, weak university curricula, infrastructure challenges 
and programme leadership. Successful parks are, furthermore, located in countries or sub-regions where literacy rates 
and human Development index (hDi) ratings are high, have relatively stable governments and have the right balance 
of both government and private sector interest and sponsorship.
The location of an iCt park is also quite crucial in supporting these success criteria. For example, the proposed Konza 
City in Kenya is being built 60 km from nairobi, on the opposite side of the perennially crowded central business 
district from the airport. at the same time, it is building the infrastructure improvements to ensure that this is not a 
bottleneck, e.g. independent power supply incorporating green elements, water management and a mass-transit trans-
portation model.
Clearly, governments have been the primary drivers behind these efforts, which is appropriate given the scale of the 
operational and regulatory challenge. The donor community can be helpful in sharing best-practices and providing 
access to finance to develop the projects (e.g. iFC, afDb, other development banks).
ReCoMMendATIon    9.7
support ICT entrepreneurs
Kenya, Morocco and nigeria have established themselves in the iCt marketplace, and, although there are still many 
challenges that each nation faces, they have successfully advanced their journey to offer best practice to their fellow 
african nations. in particular, all three have removed roadblocks and created pathways for iCt entrepreneurs to be 
successful from which others may learn.
 
One example is overcoming the high cost to entrepreneurship, which reduces the tendency for talent to move into in-
novative ventures. a solution to this includes reducing that cost by decoupling business and personal success through 
the creation of fellowships and business development programmes. another challenge is the perceived lack of quality 
and trust in african business. however, through the creation of joint initiatives with local companies and partnerships 
with international bodies, this too can be overcome. The donor community can support these programmes through 
both financial and technical assistance.
