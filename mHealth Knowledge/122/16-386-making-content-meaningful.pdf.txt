2   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
Introduction
The open educational resources movement—a growing movement to share knowledge, ideas, 
resources, and teaching methodologies—is increasing in part because of growth in digital 
technologies. 
“At the heart of this movement is the simple and powerful idea that the world’s knowledge is a 
public good and that technology in general and the World Wide Web in particular provide an 
extraordinary opportunity for everyone to share, use, and reuse knowledge.”1
The abundance of openly accessible health content—from eLearning courses and multimedia 
resources to guidance documents and research papers—presents a remarkable opportunity 
for teaching, learning, and sharing. Accessibility to and use of these resources can be a matter 
of life and death. A literature review showed that there is a lack of knowledge in some low- and 
middle-income countries about diagnosis and management of common diseases. This can lead 
to suboptimal, ineffective, and dangerous health care practices.2  The need for a knowledgeable 
health workforce is critical to address the dual epidemics of noncommunicable and infectious 
diseases in low-and middle-income countries.
Open health content, however, is not sufficient by itself. It is important to provide it in the 
appropriate context and the language of the people who will use it. For example, a family 
planning eLearning course that is only in English is worthless when offered to non-English 
proficient community health workers. Likewise, a program that sends antenatal health messages 
by SMS (short message service or text message) to pregnant women is futile for an audience with 
low literacy. Despite the abundance of evidence-based health content, not all of it is relevant or 
ready to use.
How do you make existing open health content useful? The answer is adaptation. Adaptation is 
the process of using existing content to create content that is relevant and accessible (digitally or 
otherwise) in a given context. Adaptation is both evidence based and innovative—taking content 
proven in one context and applying them in another. Educators, trainers, content providers, and 
even technologists must be able to identify knowledge needs and adapt evidence-based content 
to address these needs.
“Addressing the lack of locally relevant content is critical to ensuring that 
mobile and digital technologies are inclusive and that end-users fully 
maximize the technologies’ transformative potential.” 3 
 INTRODUCTION   3
Who This Guide Is For
The intended users of this guide are program managers and implementers working in the health 
and development sectors who are interested in taking advantage of openly accessible health 
content—without having to develop content from scratch—to better serve their clients and 
communities. On a broader level, this guide is for anyone interested in adapting, repackaging, 
and redistributing open access educational content in different delivery formats. 
The Knowledge for Health (K4Health) project developed this adaptation guide to expand the 
reach, usefulness, and use of evidence-based global health content, specifically as it relates to 
family planning.
K4Health uses knowledge management approaches to help improve global health programs in 
low- and middle-income countries. Knowledge management is a systematic process of collecting 
and curating knowledge and connecting people to it so they can act effectively.
How To Use This Guide
In this guide, we propose a content adaptation framework with three phases: Before, During, 
and After. 
Before is the formative stage when you Understand and Scan the audience, the audience’s 
needs, and the existent content that is available. During is the implementation stage when 
you Design and Deliver to adapt the existent content. After is the evaluation stage when you 
Evaluate and Learn from the experience and develop ideas for next steps.
4   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
Each phase includes a set of steps along with specific tips and examples of existing content. 
We provide hypothetical scenarios to help you understand these concepts in action, and 
practice activity sheets to guide your own adaptation activity. Through the course of this guide, 
you will find that adaptation is not an isolated process; it often requires the input of multiple 
stakeholders. You are therefore encouraged to review this guide and work through the activities 
with members of your organization who might be involved in the adaptation activity.
There are three general types of adaptation:
• Adaptation that makes content appropriate to a specific cultural context
• Adaptation that changes content into a local language
• Adaptation that makes content available through a different delivery format that is 
appropriate for the local context
Our aim is that this guide can be applied to most adaptation efforts that use open access 
educational content, digital or otherwise. 
The case studies at the end of the second phase (Design and Deliver) provide real-life 
examples and lessons learned based on a variety of different delivery formats:

Before: Understand and Scan
The Understand and Scan phase is the formative planning stage of the adaptation process. 
Who is the intended audience? What information do they need? What content exists that can be used 
or adapted?
Before
STEP 1:  Define the audience
STEP 2:  Conduct a knowledge needs assessment
STEP 3:  Determine the learning objective(s)
STEP 4:  Evaluate existing content
Understand 
and scan
6   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
Step 1: Define the Audience
Who am I trying to reach?
In this first step, you will define the audience.
Consider the following scenario: 
Fatima works at the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Mahidtial (a fictitious country) as the 
family planning and reproductive health program officer. The MOH recently issued 
a policy to integrate family planning (FP) counseling and services into the maternal, 
newborn, and child Health (MNCH) services offered by community health workers (CHWs) 
in Mahidtial. As part of their two-year training program, CHWs received a brief training on 
FP. Fatima has been asked to lead the activity of refreshing CHWs’ FP knowledge, especially 
as it relates to contraceptive pills and condoms and counseling for other contraceptive 
methods that require a referral to district hospitals. As part of the formative research 
process, she and her team identified district X to pilot the rollout due to the reported  
high unmet need for family planning spacing methods among postpartum women.
In the scenario described above, the audience is CHWs in district X. After defining the audience, 
consider the context in which they live and work. Understanding their needs is crucial to making 
the content relevant to them. 
Ask the following key questions:
• What does the audience want and need to learn?
• What are the audience’s current literacy levels (i.e., general literacy level, health literacy  
level, and digital literacy level)?
• Where, from whom, and how do they currently seek information on a particular health 
topic?
• What are the most commonly spoken languages among the audience?
• What are the potential challenges they face (for example, sociocultural norms, literacy,  
and access to technology)?
Use Activity Sheet 1 as a template to assess the audience’s needs and circumstances as they relate 
to issues of access, infrastructure, technology and tools, time, and resources. These will be taken 
into account in Step 2: Conduct a knowledge needs assessment. Consider whether to involve 
other people in this activity, including the audience, to provide critical input. If you do not have  
a specific audience or adaptation activity in mind, use the hypothetical scenario for practice. 
BEFORE: UNDERSTAND AND SCAN   7
Activity Sheet 1:  Understanding Your Audience
How does the audience prefer to  
access new knowledge and  
learning?
Access
What content formats (for example, 
in person, on paper, online, and by 
phone) are relevant to their culture 
and fit within their capabilities?
What level of Internet access exists 
among the audience?  How does it 
vary?  How comfortable are they  
using the Internet?
Does the audience own mobile 
Infrastructure phones?  What types of phones (basic, feature, smart)?  What is 
their comfort level using mobile 
phones?
How easy is it to reach the audience 
in person?  Where do they meet  
offline as well as online?
Are they connected to social media 
(for example, Facebook, Twitter, 
Technology  and LinkedIn)?
and Tools
What are the most feasible delivery 
channels for reaching this audience?
How much time does the audience 
have for a learning experience?
Time
Would a learning experience that 
blends instruction with on-the-job  
application be feasible for them?
What kinds of resources (for 
example, personnel, finances, and  
Resources materials) do you have available to 
support a learning experience for 
the audience?

8   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
Step 2: Conduct a Knowledge Needs Assessment
What are the knowledge gaps? What does the audience need to learn?
In Step 1 you defined the audience. Now it’s time to assess their knowledge needs. You can do this by 
using existing information or carrying out your own assessment to understand gaps in knowledge.
Recall the scenario with Fatima who works as a program officer at the MOH in Mahidtial. Once she 
understood the issues of access, infrastructure, technology and tools, time, and resources of nurses in 
district X, she assessed their knowledge needs.
In collaboration with the hospital and two health centers in district X, Fatima developed 
a paper-based survey to distribute to CHWs at the hospital and health centers during 
a monthly team meeting.  CHWs were asked to complete them and give them to their 
supervisor at the end of the meeting.   
 
Survey questions included:
• What are some of the benefits for spacing births? Of having a small family? 
• What are some short-acting family planning methods? Long-acting methods?  
Permanent methods?
• After a client has a baby, what information do you provide to them about family planning?
• What information do you provide to newly married couples about family planning?
• What contraceptive pills are commonly available? How do they work? 
• What are the benefits of contraceptive pills? What are possible side effects?
• What condoms are commonly available? How do they work?
• What are the benefits of condom use? What are possible side effects?
The survey results revealed to Fatima that most nurses were familiar with the benefits of spacing 
births and having a small family and the commonly available contraceptive pills and condoms. 
However, they were less familiar with the differences between short-acting, long-acting, and 
permanent methods and what information they should give to specific types of clients. 
As this scenario demonstrates, Fatima used the survey to gather information about the learning 
needs of CHWs in district X. The survey was used as a needs assessment—a tool to identify differences 
between current knowledge and desired knowledge. These differences represent gaps in knowledge 
that can be addressed with adapted content that is specific to the audience’s needs.

10   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
Step 3: Determine the Learning Objective(s)
What are the desired outcomes? What should the audience know or be able to do?
After identifying the knowledge needs of the audience, it is time to determine the learning 
objectives. Learning objectives are goals that describe what the audience will know or be able to 
do as a result of a learning activity or intervention.
For this step, we look at Bloom’s Taxonomy, a framework used in education that classifies what we 
expect or intend our audience to learn from an activity or intervention. The Bloom’s Taxonomy 
framework (Figure 1) illustrates how to move from lower levels of knowledge (remembering) and 
comprehension (understanding) to higher levels of knowledge (applying, analyzing, evaluating, 
and creating). Below each level of the framework are examples of verbs that can be used to 
formulate a corresponding learning objective. For example, the ability to define the benefits of 
spacing births demonstrates basic knowledge of family planning and healthy timing and spacing 
of pregnancies. And the ability to compare the differences between short-acting, long-acting, and 
permanent methods, for example, demonstrates a higher level of knowledge.

BEFORE: UNDERSTAND AND SCAN   11
After identifying the audience (Step 1) and their knowledge needs (Step 2), determine which level 
of knowledge in the taxonomy to change. This will help identify the desired learning objective(s) 
of the content adaptation process. The objective(s) should be SMART:
Specific:  Is the desired outcome and audience clearly specified?
Measurable:  Can the achievement of the objective be quantified and measured?
Appropriate: Is the objective appropriate given the learning intervention?
Realistic:  Can the objective be realistically achieved with the available resources?
Timely:  In what time period will the objective be achieved?
Recall the scenario with Fatima and the knowledge needs of CHWs in district X�
The knowledge needs assessment survey results revealed to Fatima that most CHWs in district 
X were not familiar with the differences between short-acting, long-acting, and permanent 
methods of contraception and what information they should provide to specific types of 
clients, such as postpartum women and newly married couples. 
Based on these results, she and her team developed the following objective that addresses the 
CHWs’  knowledge needs:  By the end of the in-service training program, CHWs in district X 
will have a 50% increased knowledge about the difference between short-acting and  
long-acting family planning methods, as measured by a post-intervention survey�
The MOH evaluated whether the objective met the SMART criteria.  Let’s see . . .
 
Specific? Y es! It specifies the audience (CHWs in district X) and the intended  
outcome (increased knowledge about the difference between short-acting  
and long-acting family planning methods)
Measurable? Y es! Levels of awareness can be measured in a post-intervention survey.  Ideally, 
a pre-intervention survey would establish a baseline.
Appropriate? U nknown. The content of the training program would need to be evaluated  
to determine whether it addresses awareness of the different types of family 
planning methods.
Realistic? U nknown. Whether the 50% increase is a realistic expectation would  
need to be evaluated.
Timely? Yes! The time frame is specified as the end of the in-service training program.
Now, it’s your turn! For practice, use the example objective in Activity Sheet 2 to determine 
whether it addresses each SMART criteria.
12   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
Activity Sheet 2:  Is This Learning Objective SMART? Explain Why�
By the end of the in-service training program, 100% of CHWs in district X will be able 
to correctly counsel postpartum clients on the benefits of spacing births and the 
range of contraceptive methods available to them as reported in post-visit client 
facility surveys.
Specific:
Measurable:
Appropriate:
Realistic:
Timely:
Now that you have had some practice, develop a SMART learning objective for your adaptation 
activity by filling in the blanks in Activity Sheet 3. 
In addition to developing the learning objective(s), determine how you will verify that the objec-
tives are met. Your objective statement should explicitly state how success will be measured.

BEFORE: UNDERSTAND AND SCAN   13
Step 4: Evaluate Existing Content 
Is the existing content appropriate to use? What is no longer relevant?
In the last step of the Understand and Scan phase, you will review existing content to see if it 
can be reused or easily adapted to meet your SMART objective(s) and the audience’s knowledge 
needs, and how it might be adapted.
Once again, we return to Fatima, the program officer in Mahidtial�
At this point, Fatima’s team has developed a SMART learning objective that addresses  
the CHWs’ knowledge needs:  By the end of the in-service training program, CHWs in  
district X will have a 50% increased knowledge about the difference between short-acting 
and long-acting family planning methods, as measured by a post-intervention survey
Rather than creating a new training plan from scratch, Fatima and her partners look for 
existing content and materials that they can potentially adapt and use for CHWs in district X.  
A year earlier, in collaboration with MOH, the Mahidtial Medical Association developed LARC 
guidance documents, including fact sheets and job aids, for nurse midwives at a national 
seminar.  Given the credibility of the source and the relevance of the content, Fatima’s team 
intends to use these documents and incorporate them into the training plans for CHWs in 
district X.
As the scenario above highlights, there are a number of factors to consider in determining 
whether existing content is appropriate for adaptation. In the scenario, they determined that  
the existing content was appropriate based on its relevance and the credibility of its source.
14   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
Consider the following factors to determine whether to use an existing resource:
Credibility of resource:  Does the information come from a reliable source? 
Is the information accurate and supported by evidence?
Resource components:  Are there technical guidelines, case studies or 
scenarios, quiz questions, graphics or multimedia, or other important 
elements that could be reused?
Relevancy of content:  Is the presented information largely up to date and 
relevant for your current audience, in terms of reading level, language, or 
cultural appropriateness? Is it already presented in a way that you can use 
it? Or will it require additional content or editing?
Technology capacity:  What technology capabilities do you have to 
repackage existing content into a format accessible and appropriate for 
the audience?
Human capacity:  What human resources do you have to make any 
content-related or technology changes?
Permissions: Make sure you have permission to use or repurpose the content� This can 
generally be done in two ways:
1. Some content has been specifically developed and made available for further use, reuse, and 
adaptation. See the Training Resource Package for Family Planning website (www.fptraining.
org) and the ORB website (www.health-orb.org) for examples.
2. In other cases, you may need to view a resource’s privacy and terms of use information or 
check to see if there is language or a visual icon representing a Creative Commons license or 
the Public Domain Mark 1.0. For examples of each, see Appendix A.
BEFORE: UNDERSTAND AND SCAN   15
When you are unsure if you have permission to adapt a resource or content, contact the author 
or organization directly. We also recommend acknowledging and crediting the original source 
whenever possible, even if it is published with an open license. Citing your sources enhances 
your own credibility and the perception of your product. Directly taking any words from a source 
or even paraphrasing from a source without crediting the appropriate author is considered 
plagiarism and is a violation of ethical standards. 
The Currency, Relevancy, Authority, Accuracy, Purpose test (Appendix B) is another useful tool that 
can evaluate the quality of a resource.
Tips for Evaluating Content Found Online
When searching online for existing content, consider the following tips to evaluate their 
quality.9 
• Check the domain:  .gov, .edu, .org refer to government, educational institutions, 
and non-profit organizations, respectively.  Generally, the information in these types 
of sites is considered to be from a credible source.  (Note that many country codes, 
such as .us, .uk, and .de are no longer tightly controlled and may be misused.)
• Check the author:  Hold the author to the same degree of credentials, authority, 
and documentation that you would expect from something published in a reputable 
print resource (book, journal article, good newspaper).
• The page should be dated. 
• Sources should cited with footnotes or links. 
Special Consideration for Graphics and Multimedia
Photographs, graphics, video, and sound files can be rich sources for adaptation. It takes time, 
tools, and skill to adapt any content, but even more so for graphics or multimedia.
Consider the following questions:
• Does the audience have a reliable Internet connection and do they know how to download 
or view multimedia content?
• Do you need special equipment or software to adapt the multimedia content?
• Does your staff have the capacity to adapt the content, or can you hire someone?
If you answer “no” to the last two questions, there are free tools (for example, Microsoft Paint and 
Movie Maker) and websites (Photoshare.org, Camstudio.org, Picresize.com, and Audacity) that 
can help you to start to adapt and create multimedia content.

DURING: DESIGN AND DELIVER   19
Step 5: Determine the Appropriate Delivery Format 
What format will address the audience’s needs?
Once you have identified existing content with appropriate information for the audience, 
consider how to deliver the adapted content. For example, you can adapt existing audio content 
into SMS or vice versa. Job aids can be transformed into an eLearning course. Content from an 
eLearning course can be adapted into video or even as part of a blended learning initiative. The 
delivery format does not always have to change. For example, existing audio content can be 
transformed into new adapted audio content for a different audience.
While the combinations and possibilities may seem endless, it’s important to consider the needs 
of the audience and issues of access, infrastructure, technology and tools, time, and resources 
from the Understand and Scan phase to decide what the delivery format should be for the 
adapted content. The case studies at the end of this phase provide real-life examples and lessons 
learned based on a variety of delivery formats.
Activity Sheet 4 includes a list of common formats of content. You can use this activity sheet to 
help you map out which delivery format(s) you plan to use for the adapted content. Note that it 
is common to use multiple delivery format(s) to reinforce learning objectives for your intended 
audience.

Step 6: Repurpose the Content
What needs to be adapted? How do I best adapt the content?
There are three main kinds of adaptation:
• Adaptation that makes content appropriate to a specific cultural context
• Adaptation that changes content into a local language
• Adaptation that makes content available through a different delivery format appropriate 
for the local context
Your adaptation activity might include just one or a combination of the approaches above. At the 
end of this phase, we highlight the case studies listed below to demonstrate these combinations 
of adaptation.

During this transformation process, it is critical to consider what you learned about the audience 
from the Understand and Scan phase. Any concepts, messages, or materials that you develop 
should be relevant and meaningful, and specific to the audience. 
Consider the following questions when adapting content for each delivery format:
• What key elements can be reused and adapted?
• What style and tone will work best for the audience?
• What is the appropriate length and technical depth of the adapted content?
22   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
Key Elements
The key elements are the focal point of any content. They are the pieces of content that you want 
to retain, containing the most pertinent information to be presented to the audience. This can be 
accomplished by a combination of text, graphics, audio, or video, depending on the literacy level 
of the audience. Box 3 includes best practices for using different types of key elements.
Box 3�   Best Practices in Using Key Elements 
Tips for any delivery format:
• Consider the local language, common slang, local expressions, traditions, taboos, 
and laws.
• Be mindful of the relevance and appropriateness of metaphors.
• Keep language simple.
• Consider brief stories or examples that the audience can relate to.
Graphics with text:
• Should be legible.
• Should be easy to understand.
• Should be simple. Remove unnecessary details and clutter.
Graphics without text (example, photos or other imagery):
• Make sure the imagery is objective and accurately represents or illustrates a real 
situation, subject, or physical location.
• Relevant and relatable to the audience.
• Was obtained in an ethical manner. Received permission from the subject.
Audio:
• Whenever possible, a native speaker should narrate. 
• The narrator should speak slowly and clearly.
Video:
• Film in the country in which the learning intervention will be implemented.
• Model respectful behavior.
• Include voice-over whenever possible.
• Consider close-ups and animated content as appropriate for the subject matter.
DURING: DESIGN AND DELIVER   23
Style and Tone
What is the right tone to take with the audience? How do they speak? What terms are they 
familiar with?
In general, content should be presented in a way that is engaging to the audience. Your tone 
may differ when you are trying to connect with a personal audience (for example, friends, family, 
and colleagues) compared with a professional audience (for example, donor agencies and an 
organizational audience). The content should be relevant and engaging. Relevancy can be further 
developed by being clear, concise, and accurate and by using illustrative examples. 
In Box 4, we offer resources for writing and designing easy-to-understand content.

realising-the-smartphone-opportunity
Length
Do you want your message to cut through information overload? Be brief.
Once you have identified key elements—the pieces of the content that must be retained—think 
about how many words you need. This might depend on your adapted format; for example, Twit-
ter and SMS have strict character limits. Can you get your messages across in the space you have? 
Even when you have more room to work with, a more concise message is more useful. Images 
and graphics can get messages across without words, but make sure those images will work on 
the audience’s devices.
24   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
Consider the following principles for determining appropriate length based on instructional 
design guidance:
• Condense your sentences by breaking up long sentences (more than 20 words) with short ones.
• Avoid jargon, use simple language, and get to the point. Remember to keep it simple.
• Chunk content. Use short sentences or paragraphs. Use bullet points, imagery, and multimedia as 
appropriate for your delivery format.
• Eliminate unnecessary adjectives or descriptors.
In Box 5, we offer an example of how to apply these principles about length.
Box 5�   Appropriate Length of Content
Background:  K4Health collaborated with Dimagi (a social enterprise that delivers open-
source technology in underserved communities) to adapt and translate Global Health 
eLearning Center family planning content for Hindi-speaking frontline health workers

DURING: DESIGN AND DELIVER   25
Step 7: Test the Adapted Content and Delivery Method
Iterate. Iterate. Iterate.
There is no mathematical formula for making content relevant or the delivery method success-
ful. Testing, however, can get you closer to your objective. In this step, test your content by first 
soliciting feedback about your adapted content, and then using that feedback to inform your 
decisions about any changes that need to be made. You may have to cycle through this process 
multiple times.
Who to Involve
Think about who the end users are, and if possible, involve them in your feedback process. It may 
not be possible to have your end users test the final product. If that’s the case, involve people 
who are familiar with the local context.
How to Receive Feedback
Usability testing experts have shown that testing only five users will uncover 85% of usability 
problems. To get relevant and honest feedback, it is important to ask questions without 
assumptions or judgment. Feedback discussions can be carried out in-person, through written 
responses, or virtually. Discussions could also be facilitated individually or in a small group setting.10
Keep the following tips in mind when eliciting feedback on the adapted content and 
the delivery method:
Show.  Don’t tell.  Give users the adapted content in whichever delivery format you chose. 
Let them interpret the content themselves. Listen for any comments or questions they may 
have. Whenever possible, watch how they handle and interact with it.  
Ask open-ended questions.  Avoid asking leading questions that encourage users to 
answer in a predictable way.  It is also useful to ask about their thoughts, experiences, and 
first impressions.
Be patient.  It is important to wait for responses. If you ask a question during an in-person 
discussion, sit back for a few minutes. People will give feedback when they feel ready.
Consider the group dynamic.  For group discussions, consider if there are hierarchical 
relationships that may hinder anyone’s comfort level or openness to share their thoughts.   
If so, consider separating focus group discussions or individual interviews with a selection  
of users.
Depending on the extent of the feedback you receive from participants, you may have to further 
refine, test, and gather feedback before finalizing the adapted content and delivery method.
26   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
Step 8: Promote and Deliver the Adapted Content
How do I reach the audience?
Once you have developed and tested your adapted content and delivery method, it’s time to 
share the content with the audience.  Work with partners and use existing networks as part of 
your delivery strategy. Think about who the audience is, what motivates them, and how to reach 
them online and offline.
What Motivates Your Audience?
It is important to develop communication messages for both the audience as well as champion 
stakeholders.  It is important to think about what motivates the audience.  Is a certificate of 
completion sufficient?  Is or will the adapted content be accredited?  Is a learning network or some kind 
of ongoing community building among the audience desirable?
Methods for Reaching Your Audience
Generally speaking, promotion and delivery can be done at the community level or on a 
larger scale—national or international.  At the community level, the content can be shared at 
community briefings with stakeholders.  You may also want to consider conducting a formal 
or informal training session to introduce the audience to the material.  This may be an optimal 
solution especially if the audience is unfamiliar with the chosen delivery method.  On a larger 
scale, consider submitting to online publications, online mailing lists, working groups, or social 
media.  Regardless of the level, there are generally two methods of delivery methods: written and 
oral.  The following table shows examples of each of these.

Adapting Global Family Planning Training Curricula and Research 
Into Easy-To-Read SMS in Kenya and Tanzania | FHI 360
In 2008, with funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), FHI 360’s Program 
Research for Strengthening Services (PROGRESS) project began developing Mobile for Reproductive 
Health (m4RH), an opt-in SMS-based health communication program that provides information about 
nine family planning methods and a clinic database for accessing the methods.  It was piloted and 
evaluated in Kenya and Tanzania from 2010 to 2011 in collaboration with several partners including 
the ministries of health (MOH) in both countries and Text to Change, the technological partner.
FHI 360 conceptualized, developed, and deployed m4RH as part of a research study aimed at 
determining the feasibility of providing family planning information via text message, the reach 
of this communication channel, and impact on family planning use.  FHI 360 took a systematic 
approach to adapting evidence-based global and locally relevant guidelines to the 160 character 
limit of SMS, with all content undergoing extensive user input and testing.
For the initial message development in Kenya and Tanzania, FHI 360 reviewed global resources 
that were already well synthesized. In an interview conducted for this case study, they mentioned 
specifically the Family Planning:  A Global Handbook for Providers11  as a “key resource because 
of it has well-synthesized key messages at the beginning of every chapter.”  They also reviewed 
relevant global and local training curricula, research reports, and programmatic documentation 
(for example, from family planning-focused strategic behavior change communication projects).
Figure 2� 
Synthesizing “key points”  
from Family Planning:  
A Global Handbook for  
Providers into a SMS 
message
They conducted two levels of expert review of the proposed messages:  global expert 
consultation and in-country stakeholder consultation of family planning experts, clinic partners, 
and the MOH. Once the messages were refined based on the consultations, they were translated 
and reviewed again in English (Kenya) and Swahili (Tanzania).  They were then tested with the 
audience in family planning clinics with female and male clients, who viewed the messages and 
provided feedback on language, comprehension, relevance, and trustworthiness. 
30   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
Results from the pilot indicated that women, men, young people, and couples used m4RH 
to learn about the range of family planning methods.  Users found m4RH easy to use and 
understand and reported increased family planning knowledge as well as some behavior change.
Since the pilot was completed, FHI 360 has expanded m4RH, developing and testing new 
messages using the same approach applied in the pilot.  In Tanzania, FHI 360 has developed 
additional family planning content to further address side effects and common rumors and 
misconceptions associated with different family planning methods.  FHI 360 has also adapted 
the program for young people in Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.  The youth adaptation process 
involved developing new messages about HIV, sexually transmitted infections (including human 
papillomavirus), sex and pregnancy, and puberty, as well as ensuring that the basic contraceptive 
messages are appropriate for young people.  
The process for adapting the m4RH content to other country settings and audience groups 
includes the following:
Conduct stakeholder group technical meetings to determine and prioritize content areas.  
Stakeholder input is vital to understanding method availability, contextual issues, as well as what 
the sexual and reproductive health laws and policies (especially as they relate to abortion, age of 
consent, and homosexuality) are in a given country.  This is important to consider in developing 
messages that are factual but won’t be perceived by lawmakers as encouraging something that 
is illegal.  Review endorsed local materials as well as any updated global best practices.  Share 
messages with stakeholders for their review and inputs.  Conduct focus group discussions with 
the audience, and in the case of youth in Rwanda, for example, with their caregivers as well.
In some countries, the stakeholders and audience requested more emphasis placed on content 
areas indirectly related to family planning and reproductive health, such as the impact of alcohol 
or gender-based violence.  FHI 360 used a similar approach as outlined above in developing 
messages related to those topics as well.
Key lessons learned:
• Engage global and local content experts throughout the message development and 
testing process.
• Don’t reinvent the wheel entirely—use existing content to help craft messages.
• Consider the country context, audience (their age and where they might be in terms 
of their development and family planning and reproductive health needs), and 
knowledge needs.
• Always test messages with the audience.
• Develop a promotion and delivery plan. Because m4RH is an opt-in system, its use is 
highly dependent on how much it is promoted.
   CASE STUDIES   31
Repackaging eLearning Health Content as a Mobile App  
for Community Health Workers in Ghana | Concern Worldwide/ 
Grameen Foundation
Community health nurses (CHNs) are often the primary providers of maternal, newborn, and child 
health care (MNCH) in rural Ghanaian communities.  However, CHNs face substantial challenges 
to address the health care needs of their communities, which are geographically diffused and 
often under-resourced. While CHNs serve a crucial role, they are the least credentialed nurses 
within the Ghana Health Service (GHS) and have limited opportunities for career advancement.  
Their experience reflects global trends: although there are more in-service training programs 
developed for health workers than ever before, a continuum of learning from preservice to in-
service training is sorely lacking.
From February 2014 to December 2015, K4Health collaborated with GHS and Grameen 
Foundation to give CHNs in five rural districts of Ghana access to professional development 
courses via an Android app. The Android app, developed by Grameen under Concern Worldwide’s 
Care Community Hub Project, was designed in response to challenges that CHNs reported had 
impacted their motivation and job satisfaction. These challenges included not feeling valued by 
clients, not being recognized by supervisors, lack of access to information and tools, and lack of 
peer support.  CHN on the Go had five modules to address the various challenges of the CHNs, 
including a planner, point-of-care tool, and a learning center.  K4Health provided educational 
content for the app’s learning center through the USAID Global Health eLearning Center website 
(www�globalhealthlearning�org), which K4Health manages.  The technology for the learning 
center was developed by Grameen based on OppiaMobile, an open-source mobile learning 
platform developed by Digital Campus.
The Global Health eLearning Center can be accessed via phone; however, it still requires an 
Internet connection.  On the other hand, the CHN on the Go app allows for courses, once 
downloaded, to be viewed without an Internet connection.  In addition, it is a free global 
resource, with content developed for a broad audience of public health program managers, 
health service providers, and policy makers, not specific to any one country or health cadre.  
To meet the needs of CHNs working in rural settings in Ghana, K4Health, Grameen, and GHS 
undertook a systematic approach to adapt content from the Global Health eLearning Center to 
make it more relevant and accessible to the local context.
K4Health reviewed the Global Health eLearning Center family planning and MNCH course 
content for suitability for CHNs and the local needs in Ghana based on family planning methods 
availability and CHN’s roles and responsibilities in Ghana.  The content was then reviewed by 
Grameen and GHS in detail for language and clarity, content relevance, appropriateness for 
CHNs, conformity with GHS health protocols and policies, and appropriate photos or other 
imagery that reflected the Ghanaian context.  During this stage of the adaptation process, GHS 
created additional content for key topics not included in the original courses.  The review process 
highlighted the collaborative nature of the effort, with multiple departments of the Family Health 
Division of GHS working together to revise the content for local context.
32   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
The app with the adapted content was launched in two phases to ensure two rounds of training 
with CHNs and their supervisors, testing, and iterative improvements to both the technology 
and the content based on user feedback.
•  Phase I introduced the adapted family planning courses on the app (July 2014)
•  Phase II introduced the adapted MNCH courses on the app (November 2014)
In the end, 14 adapted Global Health eLearning 
Center family planning and MNCH courses were Figure 3�  Global Health  
made available via the Android app.  About 80% of eLearning Center courses  
the content is relevant and ready to use; however, hosted on the Learning Center  
the remaining 20% needed to be adapted for the job of the CHN on the Go app
function of CHNs and the local context in Ghana.  Of 
the 234 course certificates earned (earned by passing 
a course final exam with an 85% or higher), the five 
most popular courses account for 85% of the successful 
course completion and also represent the main areas in 
which CHNs provide counseling and services:  diarrheal 
disease, family planning counseling, essential newborn 
care, malaria in pregnancy, and emergency obstetric 
and newborn care.
Key lessons learned:
• Engage local stakeholders at multiple levels of the health system.
• Align content with country protocols.
• Make sure the content is relevant to the audience’s job responsibilities.
• Adapt and/or replace visuals to make them more locally relevant.
• Seek user feedback.
• Consider user incentives!  Ultimately, the mLearning courses were accredited by 
Ghana’s Nursing and Midwifery Council.

Adapting eLearning Health Content to an Interactive Voice Response 
Training Course for Medical Training Students in Kenya | K4Health
In response to a growing demand for 
customized training content in the field, 
K4Health began to explore new ways to 
deliver the free global health technical 
content available on the Global Health 
eLearning Center to reach a wider 
audience of health program managers 
and health providers working in low- 
and middle-income countries.  While the 
proportion of households with Internet 
access has increased, accessibility and 
connectively continue to be an issue for 
the vast majority of people living in low- 
and middle-income settings.  On the 
other hand, there are almost as many

on Earth and more than three-quarters of 
them live in low- and middle-income countries.
Leveraging this reality, K4Health sought to test how easily and effectively Global Health eLearning 
Center quiz content could be adapted to an interactive voice response (IVR) platform.  IVR is 
a technology—possible with any type of mobile phone—that delivers information via audio 
recordings and enables users to provide feedback by pressing a number key.  IVR allows for 
the delivery of more robust information than SMS but does not require smartphones, Internet 
connectivity, or even full literacy because the information is audio recorded.
In 2015 K4Health, in partnership with the Kenya Medical Training College in Kitui, the District Hospital 
of Kitui, and IntraHealth International, launched the IVR family planning refresher training course.  The 
IVR course content consisted of 20 multiple-choice and true/false questions selected from the online 
final exams of the Global Health eLearning Center Family Planning 101 and Family Planning Counseling 
courses and accompanying detailed explanations.  K4Health with partners reviewed the final exams of 
the two courses and prioritized quiz questions that focused on either the methods readily available in 
Kenya and/or counseling messages specifically related to those methods.  
Audio recordings of the questions, their solutions, along with an explanation of the solution were 
provided by a local staff member from IntraHealth International’s Kenya office.  Minimal adaptation 
of the source content was necessary.  Instructions on how to complete the training were also 
recorded.  The recordings were then loaded onto the IVR platform, a customized version of 
InSTEDD’s Verboice API, which was selected as the activity’s IVR platform for its ease in customizing 
content delivery schedules and retrieving use data for reporting.
34   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
The final exams from the Global Health eLearning Center courses served as the baseline assessment 
for the IVR refresher training course.  It was discovered early in implementation that participants 
were unable to take the courses online due to limited Internet access.  All participants were given 
paper copies of the courses and final exams to complete as part of the baseline assessment.  
Then, as early as six weeks after completing the baseline assessments, participants began 
receiving the IVR training, delivered to their personal mobile phones.  Whenever a participant 
was available and ready, they would text the IVR system to prompt a call, then respond to audio 
recorded questions using their phone’s keypad.  The system indicated whether the answer was 
correct or incorrect and provided a detailed explanation via audio recording.
Following a spaced education approacha,  all participants needed to answer all 20 questions 
correctly twice.  Once a trainee answered a question correctly twice, the question was retired and 
not asked again.  Successful completion of the course occurred when all questions were retired.
A midpoint assessment was conducted in March 2016 that included administering a usability 
survey and focus group discussions to determine the effectiveness of deploying Global Health 
eLearning Center quiz questions using IVR and SMS technologies.  An endline analysis is underway 
to determine how well participants retained knowledge from the IVR refresher training course.
It was determined from this assessment that the IVR platform used in this activity was a successful 
method for delivering family planning content according to self-reported learner satisfaction.
Key lessons learned:
• Even when adapting English-language content, it is important to have local staff 
members review content for vocabulary and meaning, which might not translate to 
the local context.
• Training content should be relatable, so make sure audio recordings are done by 
native speakers taking into account local dialects and accents.
• Stakeholder engagement and local partnerships are critical, especially when rolling 
out a new technology.
• With IVR, content comprehension issues may not always be due to language or the 
quality of the audio recordings.  The variety of mobile phones used by participants and 
their familiarity with how to use their keypad can also affect the users’ experiences.
a Developed at Harvard Medical School, spaced education uses an interval reinforcement methodology that is 
scientifically proven to increase knowledge retention from 3 months to 2 years, and changes even ingrained on-the-job 
performance.

Adapting a Family Planning Health Guide as a Mobile App For Frontline 
Health Workers In Tanzania | Hesperian Health Guide/Community 
Based Initiative in Health, Water and Sanitation (COBIHESA)
Hesperian Health Guides, a partner of the Knowledge for Health (K4Health) Project, is a nonprofit 
organization that has developed and distributed health materials in over 80 languages.  Hesperian 
Health Guides recently translated and adapted an English-language chapter on family planning from 
the NEW Where There Is No Doctor book to a mobile-friendly HealthWiki in Swahili, and then further 
adapted it to a mobile app for health workers providing family planning services in Tanzania.  
Since its release in 2012, Hesperian’s “Safe Pregnancy and Birth” mobile app has received wide 
global uptake and critical acclaim, winning the “She Will Innovate” competition run by Intel 
Corporation and Ashoka Changemakersb , for providing comprehensive and accessible information 
that can be used by community health workers and midwives to support their interactions with 
pregnant women and their families.  
Building on this success, Hesperian chose to develop a mobile app to support health workers in the 
delivery of family planning services in response to the heavy global demand for its online family 
planning content.  Hesperian’s online family planning content was accessed globally by more than 
1.2 million users from August 2015 to August 2016 from 222 countries and territories.  
Over 75% of users access HealthWiki with a mobile device, therefore a mobile app with structured 
navigation could be a better tool to support health workers to counsel and deliver family planning 
services.  The mobile app also provides access to vital information offline, making it more feasible 
for use by health workers in the field.
The chapter on family planning in the book, NEW Where There is No Doctor, was originally vetted by 
expert reviewers, field-tested with community-based partners, and released in an English-language 
HealthWiki. 
The process of adapting this content for a mobile app took place in two phases:  
•  Translation to Swahili and adaptation to a HealthWiki and  
•  Adaptation of the HealthWiki to a family planning mobile app. 
Before beginning the first phase of translation and adaptation, Hesperian and COBIHESA worked 
together closely to identify elements of the English-language version that Tanzanian audiences 
may have trouble understanding or that did not translate culturally, such as sections that were not 
relevant to life in Tanzania or different names of family planning contraceptives.  
Overall, Hesperian and COBIHESA found that contextual changes were minimal because family 
planning content is largely standardized and the original content mostly matched family planning 
practices in Tanzania.

36   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
COBIHESA then translated the information from English to Swahili and adapted it for HealthWiki.  
Hesperian’s developer community reviewed the online HealthWiki for user interface design and 
experience.  COBIHESA also did a full copyedit and review of the online content and assisted with 
site testing.  Two technical experts in family planning and Swahili language reviewed the full 
module online before it went live. 
Content adaptation for the mobile app began A use case can be described 
during the translation to Swahili.  In Hesperian’s as how the primary user (e�g�, 
model, content adaptation begins with considering client, health program manager, 
differences in user interface and experience or community health worker) 
between a web page and mobile screen.  Online interacts with the mobile app 
content can serve many audiences, but mobile to achieve their goal of finding 
content must be tailored for one audience type.  information on contraceptives, 
As a result, the first step was to define the use case guidance on family planning 
before deciding on what content from the source programming, or support from 
text should be included in the mobile app. a simple job aid�
Hesperian’s mobile app is designed primarily to 
serve as a counseling tool for community health workers to guide counseling conversations with 
clients or to support decision making.  Hesperian determined this use case by looking at web 
analytics and field studies to identify which audiences use HealthWiki content the most and to 
understand what functionality would be most useful to them in a mobile app. 
Once the use case was identified, Hesperian created an outline of the important levels of 
information that community health workers need in a mobile app for this purpose.  
Next, content from the chapter on family planning was extracted to fit the outline.  As the family 
planning information in the chapter was created to satisfy multiple audiences’ needs, Hesperian 
expected challenges related to having both too much information and not enough information 
relevant to the community health worker’s needs.  During the adaptation process, content was heavily 
synthesized and content gaps were identified.  The gaps were then filled with content from other 
Hesperian publications and resources, such as the original book Where Women Have No Doctor. 
Key lessons learned:
• Start with vetted content that is relevant and appropriate to your audience. 
• Carefully define the primary audience and how the tool will achieve its goal before 
refining the content.  In this case study, the use case was defined to support frontline 
health workers, especially community health workers, to conduct counseling or to 
support decision making.
• Encourage adaptation to make the translation culturally relevant.  Hesperian’s 
model also encourages local ownership of translated materials, which increases the 
commitment to distribution and updating over time.

Adapting Health Videos for a Southeast Asian Audience to a  
Sub-Saharan Africa Audience | Medical Aid Films
Medical Aid Films uses film and innovative media to transform access in low-income countries 
to information about women’s and child health.  Bringing together leading health expertise, 
filmmakers, and frontline health workers, they create high-quality, resource-appropriate 
education and training for health workers and communities around the world.
Their collection of more than 200 films in 20 languages, which cover topics in maternal, newborn, 
and child health, are watched in more than 100 countries worldwide, reaching millions, and 
empowering them with knowledge that saves lives.
In 2014, Medical Aid Films worked with leading medical technology firm, GE Healthcare, with an 
innovative project to provide access to lifesaving information about pregnancy and childbirth for 
women in developing countries.  The project used low-cost portable ultrasound scanners with 
inbuilt film content about pregnancy and reproductive health, reaching women across Southeast 
Asia and sub-Saharan Africa at a crucial point of engagement with health workers.
GE identified four existing films (warning signs in pregnancy, what pregnant women need to 
eat, steps to a normal delivery, and family planning), which could provide valuable educational 
content to show on their ultrasound devices.  Medical Aid Films adapted the original scripts from 
10 to 15 minutes in length to new versions of 5 minutes each—the optimum length to be shown 
on the ultrasound devices.  
After collecting feedback from their team of technical advisors and local partners, they edited 
these films to produce a suite of four short ultrasound device-enabled films, and then translated 
and dubbed them into French, Swahili, and Portuguese for GE’s focus countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa.
The second stage was to adapt this content for GE’s other area of focus, Southeast Asia.  Medical 
Aid Films shared the films with local partners in Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Myanmar, 
collected feedback about how they should be adapted in terms of cultural sensitivities, country 
guidelines and local practices, and then adapted the scripts to incorporate this feedback.  
This included local advice on nutrition in pregnancy, for example, available and recommended 
food types, and adapting the animated characters to have culturally appropriate clothing.  
They filmed pieces-to-camera (when a presenter or a character speaks directly to the viewing 
audience through the camera) with two Southeast Asian midwives in the UK, worked with local 
filmmakers in Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia to film footage in local clinics, and adapted the 
animations in the original films to be culturally and geographically representative.  
38   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
The films were reviewed at each 
stage by the team of advisors.  
Once completed, they then 
translated and dubbed the 
completed suite of four films 
for Southeast Asia into Khmer, 
Vietnamese, Bahasa Indonesian, 
and Burmese.
These films support health 
workers to scan and advise 
women, and will empower women Video image from “Understanding Warning Signs of Pregnancy”, 2011,  Medical Aid Films
with lifesaving knowledge.  They are 
currently being used at 200 sites in 
Tanzania, Nigeria, East Malaysia, and Myanmar.
The films are freely available to partners upon request, under the Creative Commons license.
Medical Aid Films delivers their content through their website and social media platforms, 
through a mailing list of more than 2,000 subscribers, and through health networks such as 
Health Information For All.  Their films are also viewed more than 2 million times each year on 
YouTube.
The organization works in partnership to evaluate the impact of films on increase in knowledge 
and change of practice in a range of education and training program with partners around the 
world.
Key lessons learned:
• Adapting content provides a cost-effective method to leverage existing content to 
make it engaging, appropriate, and accessible for new audiences.
• Translating technical medical content to simple language can be challenging, and it 
involves a consultative review process of material to ensure that it’s user-friendly and 
accessible.
• It’s important to work with local filmmakers to strengthen in-country capacity.
• Sourcing translation and dubbing into foreign languages can be difficult, particularly 
when working with health information, but it can transform your reach and 
engagement with audiences.

After: Evaluate and Learn
After
STEP 9:   Evaluate whether the learning objective was met
STEP 10: Consider scaling up
Evaluate 
and learn
Evaluate and Learn is the last phase of the adaptation process.  The lessons learned from this 
phase will help you determine whether the adapted content has met the learning objectives 
of the intended audience, and what refinements you could make in the next iteration.  What 
communication channels should you use to promote the adapted content to the audience?  How 
will you know that the audience’s learning objectives are met?  Should you consider scaling up?
40   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
Step 9:  Evaluate Whether the Learning Objective Was Met
Was it successful?
During the Understand and Scan phase, you should have developed a learning objective that 
explicitly states the intended purpose of the adapted content and how it can be measured.  
You can always refer back to the Understand and Scan phase and SMART objectives for more 
guidance.
Let’s go back to the scenario with the MOH in Mahidtial as an example:
By the end of the in-service training program, CHWs in district X will have a 50% 
increased knowledge about the difference between short-acting and long-acting family 
planning methods, as measured by a post-intervention survey.
The post-intervention survey would determine whether CHWs in district X had increased 
knowledge about the difference between short-acting and long-acting family planning 
methods. If there was a 50% increase in knowledge, then the learning objective was met.
As the example above shows, sometimes it can take a long time to find out if the learning 
objective was met. While important, the learning objective should not be your only measure of 
success. To get a multi-dimensional evaluation of your adapted content, you may also want to 
consider the reach, usefulness, and use of your adapted content as potential measures of success. 
They are defined as follows:
• Reach:  Distribution of the adapted content (often quantitative)
• Usefulness:  User perceptions of satisfaction and quality of the adapted content
• Use:  Knowledge gained or knowledge applied as a result of the adapted content
See Appendix D for a table on illustrative indicators for each of these measures.
Box 7 shows an example of the indicators that K4Health and the Grameen Foundation used 
in their adaptation activity.  In Box 8, we provide a resource for monitoring and evaluating 
knowledge management programs. 
AFTER: EVALUATE AND LEARN   41
Box 7� Indicators in Action
K4Health worked with the Grameen Foundation to repackage eLearning health content to 
a mobile app. They collected the following reach and use indicators to measure success:
• Number of community health nurses (CHNs) who started a course (for all of the 
courses)
• Number of CHNs who successfully completed a course (for all of the courses)*
• Number of final exam attempts before successfully completing a course  
(for all of the courses)
• Number/percentage of CHNs who successfully completed all of the courses in the 
family planning certificate program and in the maternal, newborn, and child health 
certificate program, respectively
• Number/percentage of CHNs who successfully completed the skills assessment
*Successfully completed a course means that a CHN passed the final exam with an 85% or 
higher.

42   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
Step 10: Consider Scaling Up
To scale up or not?
Scaling up can be defined as expanding, adapting, and sustaining successful projects, programs, 
or policies in different ways over time for greater development impact.13  Specific to the health 
sector, scaling up means “doing something in a big way to improve some aspect of a population’s 
health.” 14
There are multiple dimensions of scaling up:  horizontal, vertical, and functional.  
See how these dimensions of scaling up relate to an adaptation activity:
Horizontal scaling up refers to expanding coverage of a project, program, or 
policy across more people and/or a wider area.  For an adaptation activity, this 
would relate to expanding geographical reach and/or the intended audience of the 
adapted content.
Vertical scaling up refers to creating the organizational or systematic process 
needed to permit going to a larger scale.  For an adaptation activity, this would 
relate to scaling up the delivery method.
Functional scaling up refers to going beyond one sector (such as health or 
education).  For an adaptation activity, this would relate to expanding the sector 
reach of the adapted content and/or delivery method.
In this step, consider whether the adapted content or adaptation activity should be scaled up 
at all, and if so, by how much, for how long, and in what direction(s) or dimension(s). By taking 
into consideration the evaluation results and potential operational costs, decide if scaling up is 
feasible and necessary; and if so, determine which aspect (for example, content, delivery method, 
geographic reach, or sector involvement) of the adaptation activity can and should be scaled up. 
Note that although scale up appears in the last step of this guide, the possibility of scaling up 
should always be considered in the beginning of any project or activity.
Note:  Content is only relevant if it takes into consideration the context. Adaptation is the 
process of taking solutions proven in one context and applying them to another, which 
may not always be easily replicable or scalable.  Ultimately, it depends on the objectives  
of a given activity and the local context.
AFTER: EVALUATE AND LEARN   43
Box 8 shows two examples of scaling up—FHI 360 scaled up its SMS-based health 
communication program both horizontally and vertically and the Grameen Foundation is 
working on scaling up its CHN on the Go app to provide professional development courses for 
community health nurses in Ghana.
Box 9� Scale-Up In Action
FHI 360 successfully scaled up its Mobile for Reproductive Health (m4RH) program—an 
opt-in SMS-based health communication program that provides information about nine 
family planning methods and a clinic database for accessing the methods.  It scaled up 
m4RH both horizontally beyond the two pilot countries (it is now in Rwanda and Uganda) 
and vertically—it is being adapted for a mobile app and Internet.org in Indonesia and 
Tanzania.
The Grameen Foundation and its partner Concern Worldwide are working on scaling up 
CHN on the Go, an app that provides professional development courses to community 
health nurses in five rural districts of Ghana.  They are in discussions with the Ghana 
Health Service (GHS) to scale up CHN on the Go across the country.  It is currently being 
considered as an add-on information, education, and communication (IEC) app to a 
GHS-developed data collection app, to provide health IEC materials to GHS staff, with the 
support of the United Nations Children’s Fund.  In one of the pilot regions, preparations 
are under way to scale up the app across the region, beyond the two pilot districts. 
The content is also being scaled up beyond the Care Community Hub project pilot’s five 
districts through a Jhpiego mLearning project for nursing and midwifery students.  The 
learning center of the app was adapted by Grameen for Jhpiego to deploy their own 
content, as well as the 14 Global Health eLearning courses that were adapted through  
the Care Community Hub project.
44   MAKING CONTENT MEANINGFUL
Now What?
Now that you have reached the end of the adaptation process, it is time to reflect.  
What went well?  What challenges did you encounter?  What could be done differently next time?
There is no mathematical formula to adapt content perfectly.  Translation—between languages, 
between media, between contexts—is, almost by definition, imperfect.  Adaptation is iterative.
In summary, remember the following questions related to each phase of the process to help you 
better inform your content adaptation activities.
Before (Understand and Scan)
• Who am I trying to reach?
• What are the knowledge gaps? What does the audience need to learn?
• What are the desired outcomes? What should the audience know or be able to do?
• Is the existing content appropriate to use? What is no longer relevant?
During (Design and Deliver)
• What format will address the audience’s needs?
• What needs to be adapted? How do I best adapt the content?
• Iterate. Iterate. Iterate.
• How do I reach the audience?
After (Evaluate and Learn)
• Was it successful?
• To scale up or not?
Like the adaptation process, this guide is iterative and can be improved based on your application 
of it. Please let us know:  What works for you?  What doesn’t?  How can we improve this guide to 
make it more useful for you?
Do you have stories to share about your experience with content adaptation—whether using this 
framework, or another, or none at all?
