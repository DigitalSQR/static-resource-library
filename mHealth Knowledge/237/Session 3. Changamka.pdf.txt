The Changamka perspective
• The mobile is a tool for:
– Health messaging
– Registration and data capture
– Health savings
– Health insurance 
The Problem
• Access to financing and care 
remains a major challenge 
• Private out-of-pocket 
expenditures continue to 
represent a major portion of 
healthcare spend
Commitment Medical Savings Accounts
• There is great potential for instruments that 
can be used to finance health and maternity 
care
• There is need for Innovative mechanisms to 
help low-income households save for health
•  There is evidence that many individuals want 
to save for anticipated expenses such as 
health but they need the assistance of a 
commitment device to do so successfully

Medisave: Dedicated Savings for Health
Smart card based outpatient and maternity savings plan
• We developed  an easily accessible,MPESA enabled  platform for individual and 
third party contribution to health  saving plans
• Piloted with 3,000 pregnant women at Pumwani Maternity 
•  12,500 smartcards issued to low-income customers across Kenya
Results of Evaluation of  Maternity Savings Card 
Program
• Most urban women understand the need for 
facility based deliveries and the need for 
savings to meet the costs involved
• Many bought the card for convenience and 
safety of funds not savings
• The issue of transportation to facilities was 
cited as a major barrier to facility based 
deliveries 
Key Opportunities and Lessons
• Heavy investment required in marketing and 
outreach
• Target women before their 1st ANC to 
encourage them to access ANC earlier and 
save more
• Provide active reminders
• Expand provider network for wide choice
• Establish partnerships with known local MFIs 
and financial intermediaries
E-Voucher
Cost effective health subsidy e-voucher system
• Development of  a transparent avenue for donor fund dispersal 
to individual recipients
• Transformation of the fraud prone voucher system through 
real time transaction transmission and e-monitoring capability
Our e-voucher program in Vihiga 
County (2011-2014)
• Methodology:
–  A Randomized Control Trial was applied  to 
establish which of the following  combination 
of factors had the greatest impact in increasing 
facility based care:
•  Affordability of maternal health (ANC, Delivery and 
PNC e-vouchers)
•  Role of conditional and unconditional transport 
subsidies and
•  Role of reminder and health-related SMS messages
Results 
• Voucher Outcomes:
–  In Facility deliveries: The results 
showed that
•   Having a transport vouchers increased 
in facility deliveries by approximately 
34%,
•  Having a maternity voucher increased 
in facility deliveries by between 41%
-46% (depending on the type of 
voucher), and 
• Having a combination of conditional 
transport and full maternity vouchers 
increased deliveries by over 50%.
– ANC visits: The results showed that
•  Transport vouchers were a significant 
motivation for ANC attendance
• The program was very effective in 
getting women to attend 4 ANC visits 
(we had instances of > 4 visits)
