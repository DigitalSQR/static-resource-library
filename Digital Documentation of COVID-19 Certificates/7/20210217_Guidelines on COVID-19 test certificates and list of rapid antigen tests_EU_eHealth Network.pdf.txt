I. Introduction  
Robust testing strategies are an essential aspect of preparedness and response to the COVID-
19 pandemic, allowing for early detection of potentially infectious individuals and providing 
visibility on infection rates and transmission within communities. Moreover, they are a 
prerequisite to adequate contact tracing to limit the spread through prompt isolation. Also in 
the context of the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, surge testing in addition to 
existing testing deployment has proven to be key for controlling and suppressing further 
spread of the virus.  
While the reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, which is 
a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), remains the ‘gold standard’ for COVID-19 
diagnosis, rapid antigen tests, which detect the presence of viral proteins (antigens), are 
increasingly being used by Member States as a way of further strengthening countries’ overall 
testing capacity, particularly in case of limited NAAT capacities or where prolonged testing 
turnaround times results in no clinical utility.    
The Health Security Committee (HSC) agreed on 17 September 2020 on Recommendations 
for a common EU testing approach for COVID-191, setting out various actions for 
consideration by countries when updating or adapting their testing strategies. The 
Recommendations included Member States’ first experiences with rapid antigen tests and 
their deliberations concerning the settings and situations in which these tests should be used. 
Since then, the HSC has been discussing the use and application of rapid antigen tests in great 
depth, and has brought together a wealth of (technical) information on the types of tests used 
in European countries and the conditions applied.  
On 21 January 2021, Member States unanimously agreed on a Council Recommendation 
setting a common framework for the use of rapid antigen tests and the mutual recognition of 
COVID-19 test results across the EU2. The Council Recommendation called on Member 
States to agree on three concrete deliverables:  
1. A common list of COVID-19 rapid antigen tests that are considered appropriate for 
use in the context of the situations described in the Council Recommendation, that are 
in line with countries’ testing strategies. 
2. A selection of rapid antigen tests of which Member States will mutually recognise 
the test results for public health measures. 
3. A common standardised set of data to be included in COVID-19 test result 
certificates, further facilitating the mutual recognition of COVID-19 test results.  
Based on the information collected by the HSC, and taking into consideration the current 
epidemiological situation and the testing strategies and approaches that have been put in place 
across the EU, this document sets out the deliverables as agreed by Member States.

2 https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-5451-2021-INIT/en/pdf

This document is based on the content of the Council Recommendation and further criteria 
agreed by Member States, and considers the relevant recommendations published by the 
Commission3 as well as the updated technical report issued the European Centre for Disease 
Prevention and Control (ECDC)4 and the World Health Organization (WHO)5.  
II. Annex I: Common list of rapid antigen tests  
Point 11 of the Council Recommendation of 21 January 2021, calls on Member States to, 
without prejudice to Directive 98/79/EC, agree on and maintain a common and updated list of 
COVID-19 rapid antigen tests that are considered appropriate for use in the context of the 
situations described under point 6 and are in line with countries’ testing strategies.  
This list should be shared with ECDC and the Commission to prevent duplication of work and 
to feed into ongoing initiatives, particularly the “COVID-19 In Vitro Diagnostic Devices and 
Test Methods Database6, hosted by the Joint Research Centre (JRC). Annex I to this 
document sets out a common list of rapid antigen tests. This list has been incorporated by 
the JRC in its COVID-19 In Vitro Diagnostic Devices and Test Methods Database.  
The common list of rapid antigen tests is regularly being reviewed by Member States, and, if 
necessary, be updated in line with new results from independent validation studies becoming 
available and new tests entering the markets. These updates are also taking into account how 
mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may affect the efficacy of rapid antigen tests, allowing 
for the removal of tests no longer deemed effective. The effect of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on 
the efficacy of NAAT, in particular RT-PCR assays, will also be kept under review.  
A first update to Annex I was agreed by the Health Security Committee on 10 May 2021, a 
second update on 16 June 2021, a third update on 7 July 2021, a fourth update on 14 July 
2021, a fifth update on 23 July 2021, a sixth update on 20 October 2021, a seventh update on 
10 November 2021, an eight update on 8 December 2021, and a ninth update on 21 December 
2021. 
As stipulated in point 15 of the Council Recommendation of 21 January 2021, Member States 
will agree on a selection of rapid antigen tests of which they will mutually recognise the test 
results for public health measures. The HSC agrees that, considering that all of the rapid 
antigen tests included in the EU common list are eligible for a test certificate issued as part of 
the EU Digital COVID Certificate7, the entire list is considered to consist of rapid antigen 
tests of which Member States mutually recognise the test results for public health measures.

III. HSC Technical Working Group on COVID-19 Diagnostic Tests 
Based on the increasing political and commercial interest in the HSC agreed common list of 
rapid antigen tests, particularly in the context of the EU Digital COVID Certificate8, there was 
a need to put in place a more structured, coherent and swift procedure for updating the 
common list of rapid antigen tests. As a first step, since 10 May 2021, it is possible for 
manufacturers to submit data and information concerning rapid antigen tests that they believe 
should be considered for inclusion in the HSC agreed common list. This information will thus 
be reviewed and considered alongside the proposals put forward by EU Member States.  
Secondly, a HSC Technical Working Group on COVID-19 Diagnostic Tests was set up. This 
Working Group, consisting of technical experts from EU and EEA Member States, is 
responsible for reviewing the information submitted by countries and manufacturers, taking 
into account the latest result of independent validation studies and country practices and 
experiences. Based on this, the Technical Working Group presents proposals to the HSC for 
further updates to the common list of rapid antigen tests. The HSC thus remains the platform 
where agreement between Member States is reached for updates to the list.  
Building on the interim definitions and criteria that were agreed by the experts on 29 June 
2021, the Technical Working Group agreed on 21 September 2021 on further definitions, 
scope, considerations and criteria to be applied to independent validation studies assessing 
the clinical performance of rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 diagnosis. These further 
definitions, scope, considerations and criteria are used by the Technical Working Group in 
addition to the ones presented in Council Recommendation 2021/24/01 when assessing the 
proposals for new rapid antigen tests to be included in the EU common list. They have been 
applied to all proposals received after 12 July 2021. Concerning the rapid antigen tests that 
were included in the EU common list of rapid antigen tests before this date, the criteria will 
apply as of May 2022.  
On 6 July 2021 the Technical Working Group agreed that that the common list should not 
include rapid antigen self-tests. Moreover, on 10 November 2021, it was agreed rapid antigen 
tests that are using a mix of different sampling materials (i.e. nasal, oropharyngeal and/or 
nasopharyngeal swabs as well as other specimen types such as saliva) can be included in the 
EU common list, however, only the validation results based on nasal, oropharyngeal and/or 
nasopharyngeal swabs of such devices will be reviewed by the Technical Working Group and 
assessed against the specified criteria. Only test results based on nasal, oropharyngeal and/or 
nasopharyngeal specimens should be valid for the issuance of test certificates for the EU 
Digital COVID Certificate. Rapid antigen tests that are solely based on sampling materials 
other than nasal, oropharyngeal and/or nasopharyngeal specimens (e.g. saliva, sputum, blood 
and/or faeces), are not included in the EU common list of antigen tests. 
On 14 December 2021, the Technical Working Group discussed the performance of rapid 
antigen tests in the context of the emerging Omicron variant of concern. In particular, 
                                                          
8 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R0953&from=EN.

concerns were raised about rapid antigen devices that are solely targeting the spike protein 
(thus not combined with the nucleocapsid protein). The Technical Working Group will 
continue monitoring the situation including emerging evidence on the potential impact of the 
Omicron variant of concern on the performance of COVID-19 rapid antigen tests and, if 
necessary, amend the agreed criteria accordingly. For the time being, rapid antigen tests that 
target the S-protein or for which the target protein is unknown have been highlighted in the 
EU common list.    
Agreed scope of the EU common list of rapid antigen tests: 
 The EU common list includes rapid antigen tests that are used in practice in at 
least one EU Member State and that have been validated by at least one EU 
Member State.  
 The EU common list includes rapid antigen tests for which their clinical 
performance was measured based on samples collected from nasal, 
oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal specimens and that meet the criteria as further 
specified below. 
 Rapid antigen tests that are solely based on other sampling materials, such as 
saliva, sputum, blood and/or faeces, are not included in the EU common list of 
antigen tests. This is in line with current evidence and the technical 
recommendations provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and 
Control (ECDC)9.  
 Rapid antigen tests that are using a mix of different sampling materials (i.e. 
nasal, oropharyngeal and/or nasopharyngeal swabs as well as other specimen 
types such as saliva) can be included in the EU common list. However, the 
validation studies of such tests should present the results and data for each 
specimen type separately. Only the validation results based on nasal, 
oropharyngeal and/or nasopharyngeal swabs of such devices will be reviewed by 
the Technical Working Group and assessed against the specified criteria.  
 Only test results based on nasal, oropharyngeal and/or nasopharyngeal 
specimens should be valid for the issuance of test certificates for the EU Digital 
COVID Certificate.  
 The EU common list of antigen tests does not include rapid antigen self-tests. It 
only includes those rapid antigen tests that are conducted by trained healthcare 
personnel or trained operators where appropriate (in line with Commission 
Recommendation (EU) 20202/1743 of 18 November 2020).  
 The EU common list of antigen tests does not include pooled rapid antigen tests, 
which involve mixing of multiple samples together in a batch or pooled sample 
for testing.  
 Only rapid antigen tests that carry CE marking are included in the EU common 
list of antigen tests.

5 
 
 
 The Technical Working Group will continue to monitor the developments in the 
field of rapid antigen testing and will, if deemed necessary, reconsider the scope 
of the EU common list of rapid antigen tests once relevant evidence and data has 
become available. Particular attention will be paid to breakthrough infections 
among vaccinated individuals and the possible impact of such cases on the 
clinical performance of rapid antigen tests, as well as the performance of rapid 
antigen tests in the context of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.  
Agreed definition and considerations of an independent validation study: 
 A study that may involve collaborations with or that may involve funding by 
private entities, however, there is always a public body involved from an EU 
Member State.  
 Such study should be carried out in an EU Member State, and be performed 
objectively and in the public interest. 
 Such study should be performed by an independent laboratory, which is a 
laboratory not owned nor operated by the manufacturer or sponsor of the test, 
and which is not related to the operator by ownership, familial relationships, nor 
contractual or other relationships that result in the laboratory being controlled by 
or being under the common control of the operator. 
 Such study should preferably be based on a prospective clinical field study 
design, testing unselected symptomatic and asymptomatic participants for 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Until May 2022, validation studies carried out based on 
retrospective in vitro study designs, testing the clinical performance of rapid 
antigen tests using SARS-CoV-2 reference panels, will be accepted too10.  
 “Unselected” means no prior knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (e.g. 
determined by PCR); inclusion is allowed based on general possible COVID-like 
symptoms (or close contact with COVID-19 cases); and exclusion is allowed of 
children (e.g. <16 years) or for medical ethical permission reasons. 
Agreed clinical performance criteria for independent validation studies: 
Prospective clinical field studies: 
 A sensitivity over 80% when testing unselected symptomatic participants within 
the first seven days after symptom onset or asymptomatic participants, where the 
diagnosis is confirmed by RT-PCR in independent field studies, will be accepted. 
OR 
In independent evaluations of unselected participants, assays should have a 
sensitivity of 90% or greater for subjects with a Ct < 25.   
 The study population shall be clearly defined stating the inclusion criteria of 
participants (symptomatic individuals, close contacts or asymptomatic 
                                                          
10 After May 2022, only rapid antigen tests of which their clinical performance has been evaluated through independent 
validation studies based on prospective clinical field study designs (in combination with retrospective in vitro studies) will be 
accepted for inclusion in the EU common list of rapid antigen tests.   
6 
 
 
individuals without known exposure). Ideally, the sensitivity for each group 
should be discernible from the report. The RT-PCR protocol and the distribution 
of Ct values should be described. Samples should represent naturally occurring 
viral loads. 
 Target population considered in the context of an independent validation study 
should be based on at least 100 RT-PCR positive samples and at least 300 RT-
PCR negative samples. Each specimen type should be evaluated separately. 
 In case of multiple smaller prospective clinical field studies that do not meet the 
minimum number of positive and/or negative samples separately but that do 
meet all the other criteria as agreed by the Technical Working Group, the 
number of samples may be combined, provided that the different studies applied 
the same or similar methodologies and that sufficient details are provided on 
their study design.  
 Assays should have a specificity over 98%. 
 In line with the MDCG Guidance on performance evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 in 
vitro diagnostic medical devices11, preference is given to samples being 
compared against RT-PCR results on nasopharyngeal swabs. However, in 
independent validation studies, samples can also be compared against RT-PCR 
results on oropharyngeal or nasal swabs if reasoning is provided (e.g. when 
assessing the clinical performance of rapid antigen tests among children). 
Retrospective in vitro studies:  
 A sensitivity over 80% when testing all specimen in the reference panel will be 
accepted;  
OR 
Assays should have a sensitivity of 90% or greater for subjects with a Ct < 25.   
 The composition of the reference panel should be as follows:  
• A panel of at least 50 pooled clinical specimens that cover naturally 
occurring viral loads with SARS-CoV-2 concentration ranging from 
approximately 1.1 x 109 to 4.2 x 102 genome copies per mL of specimen 
and Ct values between 17 and 36.  
• The whole evaluation panel should be subdivided into three subgroups: 
panel members, which are characterized by: 
• Very high viral load (Ct value 17-25; about 40% of the total 
number of pooled clinical specimens); 
• High viral load (Ct value 25-30; about 40% of the total 
number of pooled clinical specimens); and 
• Moderate viral load (Ct value 30-36; about 20% of the total 
number of pooled clinical specimens).  
• For each pool up to ten clinical respiratory specimens 
(nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal) obtained for routine diagnostics with 
different virus loads may be used. The sample volume per panel 
member should be sufficient to allow comparative evaluation with 
                                                          
11 https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/default/files/md_sector/docs/mdcg_2021-21_en.pdf  
7 
 
 
different tests included in the evaluation. 
• RT-PCR needs to be applied to determine the RNA load per pool.  
• Ethical approval by an institutional review board is mandatory.  
• For each rapid antigen test and panel member, a pre-defined aliquot 
needs to be completely absorbed using the specimen collection device, 
e.g. swab, provided with the respective test. 
• Further steps needs to be strictly performed following the respective 
instructions for use (IFU). 
• The stability of the panel (antigen) must be considered throughout the 
preparation of the panel and the workflow up to the test. 
 Assays should have a specificity over 98%, as measured through the retrospective 
in vitro evaluation study or as specified by the manufacturer in the IFU.  
 In line with the MDCG Guidance on performance evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 in 
vitro diagnostic medical devices11, preference is given to samples being compared 
against RT-PCR results on nasopharyngeal swabs. However, in independent 
validation studies, samples can also be compared against RT-PCR results on 
oropharyngeal or nasal swabs if reasoning is provided (e.g. when assessing the 
clinical performance of rapid antigen tests among children). 
As a wide range of different methodologies and protocols are being applied in countries, 
discussions on testing approaches will continue, with the overall goal for the Technical 
Working Group to develop and agree on an EU harmonised approach for validation studies 
assessing the clinical performance of COVID-19 rapid antigen tests. This work will take into 
account the ongoing work by the In Vitro Diagnostics Working Group of the Medical Device 
Coordination Group regarding guidance on the performance of COVID-19 tests in the context 
of CE-marking and common specifications under Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2017/74612.  
Grace period 
Whenever updates are made to Annex I, a grace period of 8 weeks applies whenever such 
updates are made before the end of 2021. As of 1 January 2022, a grace period of 4 weeks 
will apply. The grace period applies to both the inclusion of new devices as well as the 
removal of rapid antigen tests that are included in the EU common list or rapid antigen tests.  
  
                                                          
12 The Medical Device Coordination Group is set up according to Art. 103 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and Art. 98 of 
Regulation (EU) 2017/746. This group is also responsible for overseeing the implementation of Directive 98/79/EC. See also 
Register of Commission Expert Groups and Other Similar Entities, code number X03565, and its subgroups.

IV. Annex II: Common standardised set of data for COVID-19 test certificates   
In order to facilitate in practice the mutual recognition of results of rapid antigen tests as well 
as NAAT, including RT-PCR assays, point 18 of Council Recommendation 2020/1475 
defines that Member States should agree on a common standardised set of data to be included 
in the form for test result certificates.  
Based on information that was submitted by members of the Health Security Committee in 
response to a survey on mutual recognition on COVID-19 test results and further discussions 
that took place in the context of the Health Security Committee, Member States agree on the 
common standardised set of data for COVID-19 test result certificates as presented in 
Annex II. Member States agree that COVID-19 test results should be made available in the 
national language(s) of the country where the test was taken, as well as English.  
An update to this Annex was agreed by the Health Security Committee on 19 March 2021, 
addressing input received from the eHealth Network and in particular the Semantic Subgroup 
and based on discussions that took place in the context of the EU Digital COVID Certificate.  
The Health Security Committee will discuss, whenever relevant, possible updates to the 
agreed common standardised set of data for COVID-19 test certificates, and publish, if 
necessary, an updated agreed document.  
V. Annex III: Common list of laboratory-based antigenic assays   
In addition to COVID-19 rapid antigen tests, as of 8 July 2021, it is possible for 
manufacturers and countries to put forward proposals for laboratory-based antigenic assays 
(e.g. enzyme immunoassays such as ELISA or automated tests) for review by the Technical 
Working Group. These proposals are reviewed by the experts against the same criteria used 
for the review of rapid antigen tests.  
Annex III sets out those laboratory-based antigenic assays that meet these criteria. Further 
criteria for lab-based antigenic assays may be defined at a later stage.  
Currently, a negative test results produced by a lab-based antigenic assays cannot be used for 
the issuance of the EU Digital COVID Certificate. 
The Technical Working Group on COVID-19 diagnostic devices does not, at the moment, 
review proposals for inclusion of antibody tests in the EU common list.

ANNEX I: Common list of COVID-19 rapid antigen tests13  
As agreed by EU Member States on 21 December 2021 
Disclaimer: This list was agreed by the HSC based on a proposal by the Technical Working Group on COVID-19 Diagnostic Tests. Experts participating in the Technical 
Working Group strongly recommend that use of rapid antigen tests is primarily intended for preliminary testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic patients, and note 
that rapid antigen tests should in particular be used in the specific contexts and circumstances referred to by the Commission Recommendation (EU) 2020/1743 of 18 
November 2020 and the updated technical report by ECDC on 26 October 2021. The content of the common list is based on the clinical performance data and information 
that is available at this moment in time. Updates to the common list are based on the criteria as described in Council Recommendation 2021/C 24/01 as well as the further 
criteria and definitions agreed by the Technical Working Group on 21 September 2021. The Medical Device Coordination Group Guidance on performance evaluation of 
SARS-CoV-2 in vitro diagnostic medical devices14, envisaged to form the basis for common specifications to be adopted according to Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2017/746, 
has been taken into consideration in this regard. 
Rapid antigen tests presented in boxes are so-called ‘twin tests’. These are rapid antigen tests that are identical in design and construction but, for example, branded or 
distributed under a different name. The results of independent validation studies may be transferred between twin tests.
