Average Projection
Key Lessons from Ebola
- A strong health system and disease 
surveillance mechanism would have avoided  
tragedies like Ebola
- Mobile technology is available to reduce the 
major constraints of the health system and 
could be used effectively
- Health system reforms using the mobile 
technology could have been undertaken at 
much lower cost

already exists in Africa

take charge of their health
• Africa’s home grown inventions 
could such as mobile money and e-
health are no less revolutionary and 
propel the process 
Convergence with West in 
Health Status

convergence in health between the East and 
the West in a generation.
• Africa’s own health care model based on 
community and technological advancements 
in health system strengthening will make 
convergence sooner
• This meeting will discuss frontline health 
workers, data and private sector.
