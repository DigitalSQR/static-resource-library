Foreword
The United Nations Foundation and The Vodafone Foundation are working 
together to harness the power of mobile technology in support of United 
Nations programs across the globe.  Since 2005 our £15 million Technology 
Partnership has funded the use of wireless communications to advance global 
health and disaster relief work, and to further public discourse about how 
wireless technology can address some of the world’s toughest challenges.
This fourth publication, “mHealth for Development: The Opportunity of 
Mobile Technology for Healthcare in the Developing World,” in our Access 
to Communications series evidences, through its research and selection of 
case studies, the potential of mHealth—the use of mobile communications 
(mobile phones and PDAs) for health services and information.  This field has 
the potential to transform the approach to a variety of healthcare challenges 
in the developing world by accelerating the collection and storage of patient 
data, training rural professionals with health updates and guidance, and 
personalizing to new levels the process of patients receiving and engaging in 
available medical treatment. 
As the case studies in the report demonstrate, governments, companies, and 
non-profit groups are already developing mHealth applications to improve 
healthcare and consequently save lives.  These new mobile applications, 
bypassing the fixed-line solutions, are creating new pathways for sharing 
health-related information, even in the most remote and resource-poor environments. 
We invite you to review the potential of this area of activity and join the discussion of mHealth for 
development.  We would welcome your comments and ideas at www.unfoundation.org/mHealth-report.

Introduction

Mounting interest in the field of mHealth—the provision of health-related services via mobile communica-
tions—can be traced to the evolution of several interrelated trends. In many parts of the world, epidemics 
and a shortage of healthcare workers continue to present grave challenges for governments and health 
providers. Yet in these same places, the explosive growth of mobile communications over the past decade 
offers a new hope for the promotion of quality healthcare. Among those who had previously been left behind 
by the ‘digital divide,’ billions now have access to reliable technology. 
There is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates the potential of mobile communications to radically 
improve healthcare services—even in some of the most remote and resource-poor environments. This report 
examines issues at the heart of the rapidly evolving intersection of mobile phones and healthcare. It helps the 
reader to understand mHealth’s scope and implementation across developing regions, the health needs to 
which mHealth can be applied, and the mHealth applications that promise the greatest impact on heath care 
initiatives. It also examines building blocks required to make mHealth more widely available through sustain-
able implementations. Finally, it calls for concerted action to help realize mHealth’s full potential.
The report is organized into the following sections:
1 Identifying the potential of mobile phones to improve health in the developing world
2 Defining mHealth within the context of eHealth
3 Meeting health needs through a broad array of mHealth applications
4 Examining the impacts of mHealth projects 
5 Assessing mHealth and future health needs in developing countries 
6 Identifying the building blocks for sustainable and scalable mHealth programs
7 Understanding the incentives for multiple players: mHealth value chains

4 Introduction
Though the mHealth field is still in its early stages, it has already begun to transform health delivery. Proj-
ects throughout the developing world are demonstrating concrete benefits, including:
■ Increased access to healthcare and health-related information, particularly for hard-to-reach popula-
tions
■ Improved ability to diagnose and track diseases
■ Timelier, more actionable public health information 
■ Expanded access to ongoing medical education and training for health workers 
Due in large part to the successes of pioneering mHealth programs, activity in the field is rapidly gaining 
momentum. In 2008 alone, over a dozen new mHealth applications have been implemented or are in the 
trial stage. These include: 
■ InSTEDD, a US-based non-governmental organization (NGO) that provides technology solutions for 
humanitarian and disease support, opened a development center in Cambodia where mHealth-based 
disease and surveillance solutions are being designed for the Southeast Asian region.
■ The Canadian development agency, IRDC, expanded support for a project providing nurses in the Ca-
ribbean with portable digital assistants (PDAs) to empower improved diagnosis and decision making.
■ The United Nations Foundation and Vodafone Foundation Technology Partnership, together with the 
World Health Organization (WHO), a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN), announced plans 
to expand their mobile data-gathering program to more than 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
This report profiles more than 50 mHealth projects taking place in the developing world. The long-term goal 
is that such programs will make healthcare more effective, and have a demonstrable and significant posi-
tive impact on clinical outcomes such as reduced infant mortality, longer life spans, and decreased con-
traction of disease. 
Experts across the field, and interviewed as part of this report, assert  that there is an unprecedented 
opportunity at hand to fulfill mHealth’s promise. To accelerate this momentum and fully unleash the 
potential of mHealth applications, dynamic multi-sector collaboration between groups as 
diverse as governments, multilateral organizations, and the private sector is needed. Joint 
action should be directed toward the creation of a global mHealth infrastructure that lays out common 
standards and guidelines, and serves as a repository for shared resources and best practices. This is the 
best approach for scaling mHealth solutions and maximizing the field’s capacity to serve a vital develop-
ment imperative. ■
“Right now, we are at an inflection point in terms of acceptance. 
Whether it turns out to be the peak of inflated expectation or the 
trough of disillusionment will depend on whether governments 
make the link between telecommunication policy and health, and 
the extent to which donors encourage transparency in sourcing 
and the participation of local entrepreneurs. Ultimately, the take-
up of mobile communications in the health sector isn’t really 
about technology at all.”

Potential of Mobile Phones to Improve Health in 
the Developing World
As the first decade of the 21st century draws to a close, leaders in many developing countries can point with 
pride to tremendous strides in their efforts to improve the lives of their citizens. In many parts of the world, 
citizens in emerging economies have begun to taste the fruits of higher incomes and greater access to tools 
that promise to increase their quality of life and that of their children. Yet formidable obstacles remain. Health 
challenges present arguably the most significant barrier to sustainable global development. Disease and the 
lack of adequate preventative care take a significant toll on both developing populations, measurable in dis-
ability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and economies. Despite the broad economic advances of this decade, the 
2008 UN report on progress toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) indicates continuing 
dire conditions in crucial public health areas. For example:1
■ A child born in a developing country is over 33 times more likely to die within the first five years of life 
than a child born in an industrialized country, even though the leading causes of deaths (pneumonia, 
diarrhea, malaria, and measles) are preventable through basic services and vaccinations.
■ Every minute, at least one woman dies from complications related to pregnancy or childbirth. And for 
every woman who dies in childbirth, approximately 20 more suffer injury, infection, or disease—nearly 10 
million each year.
■ An estimated 2.5 million people were newly infected with HIV in 2007.
■ Communicable, and entirely avoidable, diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and malaria continue to claim 
lives due to preventable factors such as lack of access to proper drugs and medical treatment. By cur-
rent estimates, meeting the target MDG of halving the TB prevalence rate by 2015 is unlikely.

6 Potential of Mobile Phones to Improve Health in the Developing World
Health-Related Millennium Development Goals
MDG 4. Reduce child mortality: Reduce by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015, 
the under-five mortality rate.
MDG 5. Improve maternal health: Reduce by three-quarters, between 1990 
and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio.
MDG 6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases: Have halted by 2015 
and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS; have halted by 2015 and 
begun to reverse the incidence of malaria and other major diseases.
The ability of developing countries to overcome these serious health challenges is hindered by several core 
obstacles, among them a global shortage of healthcare workers. According to the WHO, among 57 coun-
tries, mostly in the developing world, there is a critical shortfall in healthcare workers, representing a total 
deficit of 2.4 million healthcare workers worldwide.2 This human resources constraint intensifies the already 
increasing pressure on developing-world health systems. Not only must they cope with the burden of con-
taining the spread of communicable diseases associated with extreme poverty, they must also contend with 
the growing incidence of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, an effect of new-found (rela-
tive) affluence. Governments, businesses, NGOs, foundations, and multilateral organizations all recognize the 
importance of leveraging new tools and solutions to address these distinct but interrelated health challenges. 
The Promise of Mobile Technologies for Health
Mobile communication offers an effective means of bringing healthcare services to developing-country 
citizens. With low-cost handsets and the penetration of mobile phone networks globally, tens of millions of 
citizens that never had regular access to a fixed-line telephone or computer now use mobile devices as daily 
tools for communication and data transfer. A full 64% of all mobile phone users can now be found in the de-
veloping world.3 Furthermore, estimates show that by 2012, half of all individuals in remote areas of the world 
will have mobile phones. This growing ubiquity of mobile phones is a central element in the promise of mobile 
technologies for health. 
Figure 1 illustrates that developing world citizens have plentiful access to mobile phones, even while other 
technologies and health infrastructure are scarce. This explosion of mobile phone usage has the potential to 
improve health service delivery on a massive scale. For example, mobile technology can support increasingly 
inclusive health systems by enabling health workers to provide real-time health information and diagnoses in 
rural and marginalized areas where health services are often scarce or absent altogether. ■

The following section describes the major mHealth applications in developing countries and pro-
vides examples of projects where the application has been put into action.
Education and Awareness 
Popularized by teenagers in western countries and Japan who wanted a low-cost means of 
communicating with friends, short message service (SMS) messages now offer a cost-effective, 
efficient, and scalable method of providing outreach services for a wide array of health issues. 
In education and awareness applications, SMS messages are sent directly to users’ phones to 
offer information about testing and treatment methods, availability of health services, and disease 
management. Formal studies and anecdotal evidence demonstrate that SMS 
alerts have a measurable impact on and a greater ability to influence behavior 
than radio and television campaigns. SMS alerts provide the further advantage of being 
relatively unobtrusive, offering recipients confidentiality in environments where disease (especially 
HIV/AIDS) is often taboo. In the developing world, SMS alerts have proven particularly effective 
in targeting hard-to-reach populations and rural areas, where the absence of clinics, lack of 
healthcare workers, and limited access to health-related information all too often prevent people 
from making informed decisions about their health.
SMS message campaigns can be set up either as one-way alerts or interactive tools used for 
health-related education and communication. For example, a citizen may sign up to take a survey, 
delivered via SMS message, quizzing them on their knowledge about HIV/AIDS and the location 
of the nearest testing center. Depending upon their responses, information regarding where and 
how to receive a free test will be transmitted. This interactive model has been deployed in several 
countries (e.g., India, South Africa, and Uganda) to promote AIDS education and testing and pro-
vide information about other communicable diseases (such as TB), as well as to promote mater-
nal health and educate youth about reproductive health.
10 Meeting Health Needs Through a Broad Array of Applications
Education and Awareness
Project Masiluleke and Text to Change use SMS message campaigns to 
provide HIV/AIDS education in South Africa and Uganda, respectively. 
Project Masiluleke takes advantage of the 120 spare characters on free 
‘please call me’ SMS messages to provide HIV/AIDS education and 
awareness, while Text to Change employs an SMS-based quiz to test 
users’ HIV/AIDS knowledge and encourage testing and counseling. 
 
While other communication mediums, such as radio, television, voice-based information hotlines, 
and even interactive websites can be employed in the service of education about public health 
issues, SMS stands out as having several advantages over each of these: cost-effectiveness, 
scalability, convenience, broad reach, and widespread popularity in the developing world. 
By promoting health-conscious behavior, the mHealth education and awareness programs cur-
rently in place have already had positive impacts. The ubiquity and low cost of SMS messages 
hold the potential to shift the paradigm for health education by communicating with people in an 
accessible, engaging manner that both respects their privacy and gives them the tools to make 
informed choices.
Remote Data Collection
Data collection is another crucial component of public health programs. Policymakers and health 
providers at the national, district, and community level need accurate data in order to gauge the 
effectiveness of existing policies and programs and to shape new ones. In the developing world, 
collecting field information is particularly important since many segments of the population are 
rarely able to visit a hospital, even in the case of severe illness. Gathering data where patients live 
is vital, and information should ideally be updated and accessible on a real-time basis. The data 
collection process is more efficient and reliable if conducted via smartphones, PDAs, or mobile 
phones rather than paper-based surveys that must be submitted in person and manually entered 
into the central health database. 
Data collection programs have been deployed in multiple developing world countries, mainly 
as pilot projects. The most successful programs are scaling up and beginning to be deployed 
in multiple countries or regions. These initiatives are closing the information gap 
that currently exists for patient data in the developing world, enabling 
public officials to gauge the effectiveness of healthcare programs, allocate 
resources more efficiently, and adjust programs and policies accordingly.
Remote Data Collection
Hundreds of health workers have used PDAs provided by the Ugandan 
Health Information Network to collect health data in the field. Not only 
has this solution resulted in significant cost savings—25% in the first six 
months—but health workers report increased job satisfaction due to 
the greater efficiency and flexibility provided by the technology.

Remote Monitoring 
One of the areas most uniquely suited to grow in tandem with mobile technology is the remote monitoring of pa-
tients. Remote monitoring opens new possibilities for treating patients in an outpatient setting, a crucial capability 
in developing countries where access to hospital beds and clinics is limited. This group of applications consists 
of one- or two-way communications to monitor health conditions, maintain caregiver appointments, or ensure 
medication regimen adherence. Some applications may also include inpatient and out-patient sensors for moni-
toring multiple conditions. 
Evidence shows that strict adherence to a medication regime is essential for effective treatment of a variety 
of health conditions, from AIDS to diabetes. In addition, monitoring patients at home for chronic 
conditions dramatically improves survival rates. Remote monitoring applications are being 
implemented on a relatively limited basis in developing countries, but they are gaining traction in the developed 
world, particularly for chronic diseases. As the benefits of these applications are documented in the developed 
world and funding models evolve in developing countries, remote monitoring is expected to become widespread 
and significantly improve health outcomes for a wide range of communicable and chronic diseases.
Remote Monitoring
TB patients in Thailand were given mobile phones so that healthcare 
workers (themselves former TB patients) could call these patients on 
a daily basis to remind them to take their medication. Medicine compli-
ance rates reached 90% due to the introduction of this remote moni-
toring application.
12 Meeting Health Needs Through a Broad Array of Applications
Communication and Training for Healthcare 
Workers
In the Primary Healthcare Nursing Promotion Program, the National 
School for Nurses in Coban, Guatemala used an innovative combina-
tion of mobile phones, landline phones, and tele-writers to train nurses 
in this rainforest community. 
Communication and Training for Healthcare Workers
An acute shortage of healthcare workers is a major challenge facing developing country health sectors. 
Training new cadres of health professionals and empowering current workers in order to increase job 
satisfaction and reduce attrition are essential to meeting human capital needs. Connecting health 
workers with sources of information via mobile technology is a strong basis for 
empowerment, as it provides the support they need to perform their functions 
effectively and self-sufficiently.5
There is also a pressing need to improve communication among different health units to facilitate more ef-
ficient patient care. Due to the dearth of landline phones and Internet-enabled computers, it is not uncom-
mon, for example, for a patient to be sent to the regional hospital by the local clinic, only to find that there is 
no bed available. Mobile phones can help bridge these communications gaps that in the health context can 
often mean the difference between lives lost and lives saved.
Disease and Epidemic Outbreak Tracking 
Outbreaks of communicable diseases often begin in pockets, and, when left undetected, can develop 
into epidemics. Recent instances of such devastating outbreaks abound, from cholera and TB to dengue 
fever and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Deployment of mobile devices, with their 
ability to quickly capture and transmit data on disease incidence, can be decisive in the 
prevention and containment of outbreaks.
Disease and epidemic outbreak tracking mHealth applications are being used in Peru, Rwanda, and India as 
an early warning system, allowing public health officials to monitor the spread of infectious diseases. Prior to 
the adoption of mobile networks, public health officials relied upon written, satellite, and radio communica-
tion for such emergency tracking. The migration of this function to mobile systems is simultaneously improv-
ing data quality and lowering costs. 
Disease and Epidemic Outbreak Tracking
Incidents of Japanese Encephalitis were tracked real-time in Andhra 
Pradesh, India, via a combination of mobile phones and web-based 
technologies. The government used the information to better prioritize 
vaccinations based on evidence of clusters of outbreaks.

Diagnostics and Treatment Support
Diagnostics and treatment support are vitally important in healthcare—misdiagnosis or the inability to diagnose 
a condition could have serious, even fatal, ramifications. mHealth applications in this area are designed to 
provide diagnosis and treatment advice to remote healthcare workers through wireless access to medical 
information databases or medical staff. With mHealth-enabled diagnostics and treatment 
support, patients are able to receive treatment in their villages and homes, averting the 
need for expensive hospital visits, which are beyond reach for many. 
Diagnostic and treatment applications use the phone as a point-of-care device. Health workers’ phones are 
typically equipped with specialized tools, such as built-in software that leads the worker through a step-by-
step diagnostic process. Once data are entered into the system (e.g., symptoms and an image of a patient’s 
injury captured on the mobile phone), remote medical professionals can diagnose the illness and prescribe 
treatment. By eliminating the need for patient travel, these applications have the potential to dramatically in-
crease access to care. ■
Diagnostic and Treatment Support
Researchers from the University of Melbourne are creating diagnostic 
and analytical tools specifically for mobile phones for health workers in 
Mozambique. These tools include a built-in calculator for determining 
drug dosage and reference materials stored in the phone’s memory.

Examining the Impact of mHealth Projects
Formal studies and preliminary project assessments—in both the developed and developing world—demon-
strate that mobile technology improves the efficiency of healthcare delivery, and ultimately makes healthcare 
more effective. The long-term goal, and expectation, is that mHealth programs will have a demonstrable and 
significant positive impact on clinical outcomes such as reduced infant mortality, longer life spans, and de-
creased contraction of disease. Figure 4 illustrates some early results from other mHealth programs across 
the developing world. 
Much of the excitement over the potential of mHealth centers on the developing world, where mHealth 
programs put in place since the early part of the decade are now yielding actionable data that indicates that 
some of the hoped-for benefits are materializing. These studies are complemented by those conducted in 
the developed world—where mobile phones achieved a high level of penetration more than a decade ago—
that have begun to establish a significant body of evidence pointing to the health outcomes and efficiency 
gains that can result from the thoughtful design and implementation of mobile-based programs and applica-
tions. A brief review of sample mHealth programs around the world demonstrates the palpable benefits of 
using mobile phones in healthcare and prevention.
Improved Patient Health 
Published clinical studies of mHealth programs point to an increasingly strong case for expanded mHealth 
implementation. Patient health has been improved in three ways:
■ Improved compliance with treatment regimes: A 2007 Thai study showed that TB patients 
who received daily text message medication reminders jumped to over 90% adherence. A device called 
SIMpill that uses mobile technology to monitor and direct medication adherence6 also shows promise.  
6 Phoned pill reminders make inroads against TB. The Nation (Bangkok), January 28, 2007. 
Examining the Impact of mHealth Projects 15
A 2007 pilot in South Africa showed that with SIMpill, 90% of patients complied with their medi-
cation regime, compared with the typical 22 to 60% compliance rate without the system. The 
solution is now available worldwide. In the United States, a study found improved drug adherence 
rates among HIV-positive patients who received SMS 
reminders to take daily medication compared to pa-
tients who did not. The majority of studies conducted 
in Spain, Australia, Finland, and Korea on the benefits “A 2007 pilot in South

Improved Health Systems Outcomes
Efficiency gains enable improved quality of care. With ef-
ficiency gains, more resources can be freed up and distributed to a broader population, and service 
programs can be strengthened. Examples of documented efficiency gains include:
■ In Uganda, an AED SATELLIFE program that uses wireless-enabled PDAs for disease surveillance, 
collection, and reporting produced a 24% cost saving over the traditional paper approach. Eighty-
seven percent of healthcare workers involved in the program said it allowed them to make faster 
and more accurate diagnoses.8
■ A Chinese study conducted by Zhejiang University researchers found that sending text messages 
as appointment reminders improved attendance at a health promotion center as effectively as 
phone reminders, while costing over one-third less.9 
■ In the United Kingdom, researchers at the Imperial College, London, examined the health out-
comes and efficiency gains that mobile device usage might bring to their national system. They 
found that the annual direct cost of missed hospital appointments in England each year amounts 
to £575 million. These costs are in addition to higher expenditures incurred by the health system 
for patients whose health or treatment are negatively affected by missed appointments and who 
then require additional medical attention.10
“When talking about efficiency versus health 
impact, it shouldn’t be about either/or. 
Improving efficiencies can ensure that more 
people receive life-saving interventions.”

16 Meeting Health Needs Through a Broad Array of Applications
While developed countries present different economic and cultural conditions from those found in 
developing nations, the results of the studies may contain applicable lessons, especially as ‘rich world’ 
diseases become increasingly prevalent in the developing world. The World Diabetes Foundation 
predicts that by 2025, 80% of all new diabetes cases will originate in developing countries, which will 
require new approaches for dealing with this and other chronic diseases. Studies conducted in the de-
veloped world may also provide useful lessons in monitoring and evaluation, as well as study design. 
There remains a need for large-scale evidence of mHealth effectiveness, as measured by long-term, 
repeatable improved outcomes in either health or economic terms. Such studies would be particu-
larly valuable in developing country contexts, and sponsors should continue to evaluate progress in 
order to establish clear-cut proof of concept and strengthen the case for scaling programs nationally, 
regionally, and beyond.
Creating a Framework for Impact Measurement
mHealth programs that define rigorous impact assessment methods will be more likely to secure con-
tinuing funding and become sustainable over the long term. A Dalberg Global Development Advisors 
study, commissioned by the UN Foundation and Vodafone Foundation Technology Partnership on the 
use of PDAs for health information, offers a potential template for determining the effectiveness of cur-
rent and future mHealth programs. Dalberg worked with the Partnership, the WHO, Ministry of Health 
officials in pilot countries, and DataDyne—a non-profit provider of mobile health data solutions—to 
develop a theory of change and to conduct a baseline assessment of the test program’s functionality. 
The study lays out a process for monitoring the collection and analysis of health data at the local and 
regional levels. This approach identified unforeseen technical, logistical, and decision-making prob-
lems in the pilot case. For example, it was discovered that the high cost of fuel prevented Ministry of 
Health officials from going out to collect data and the short battery life of some PDAs caused a loss 
of data. Both of these issues significantly reduced the amount and quality of data available for deci-
sion making. Dalberg also monitored the use of data once it was collected, particularly in the context 
of health ministry meetings. The study identified instances where the data was not properly integrated 
into decision making and described how processes could be improved to ensure that resource alloca-
tion decisions are more data-driven. Overall, the study helped to determine both the cost effective-
ness of data collection and the outputs that flow directly from the data. 
Dalberg notes that monitoring and evaluation efforts can face critical challenges in the short term, par-
ticularly with limited budgets to fund such activities. To overcome some of these challenges, it is im-
portant to focus first on managing toward short-term outputs, such as how many PDAs are deployed. 
The next step is to correlate short-term outputs with actual long-term health impact. This is quite diffi-
cult, because the objective is often to measure outcomes that did not occur, such as decreased infant 
mortality and disease incidence, or outcomes that occur over the long term. As mHealth applications 
improve the process of data collection and the incorporation of data into decision making, this will 
provide a foundation upon which to conduct long-term impact evaluations. ■
“It’s important to have an ROI [return on 
investment] model that articulates the cost 
savings of mHealth, and also to take into account 
the economic burden of health. You are trying 
to prevent negative health outcomes, and if you 
prevent them you can’t easily measure that.”

Assessing mHealth and Future Health Needs in 
Developing Countries
Equally important to the cost-effectiveness and scalability of mHealth is its ability to provide an effective tool for ad-
dressing emerging health needs. Health experts note that within the next 15 years, policymakers and health provid-
ers in the developing world will be forced to turn their focus to prevention and early detection rather than late-stage 
treatment of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and cancer, as well as to the health needs of an aging 
population.11 These changes are being caused by trends such as migration from rural to urban areas, economic 
growth, and changing dietary habits. As developing countries tackle and make significant improvements in the 
spread of communicable disease, average income levels increase along with average life expectancy. Even a slight 
increase in income contributes to changing dietary habits, and consumption of meat products and processed foods 
is linked to the contraction of diabetes and cancer. Late detection of these diseases leads to lower survival rates 
and reduced life expectancy, and has negative consequences for social and economic development. Developing 
countries are therefore being confronted with a double burden of treating and containing the spread of communica-
ble diseases while combating a wide range of unfamiliar health challenges. Table 1 illustrates these evolving trends.

18 Assessing mHealth and Future Health Needs in Developing Countries
Shift from Communicable to Chronic Disease
Over the next 10 years the cost of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke will take a tremendous 
toll on the national incomes of developing world countries. According to estimates by the 
WHO, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke together will cost about $555.7 billion in lost 
national income in China, $303.2 billion in the Russian Federation; $336.6 billion in India; and 
$49.2 billion in Brazil. Even beyond these countries the cost will be significant. The cost of 
these diseases for Tanzania in the same period is estimated to be $2.5 billion.12
mHealth is well-positioned to address these challenges using tools currently available. For example, just as 
SMS alerts are useful in raising public health awareness of communicable diseases, these same types of 
alerts can be used to ensure patient adherence with treatment of chronic diseases such as diabetes. SMS 
alerts can be sent out to address chronic diseases and mental health issues in urban areas such as smoking 
cessation and nutrition reminders.
Many middle-income countries in the developing world (i.e., Brazil, Argentina, Thailand, Mexico, and Turkey) 
are already seeing a shift away from communicable diseases toward chronic diseases (such as heart dis-
ease and diabetes).  In these countries, there is already evidence that mHealth programs are experimenting 
with addressing a wider range of chronic non-communicable diseases, with a focus on early treatment.

The MediNet Healthcare Management System is being 
developed by researchers at the University of the 
West Indies and Microsoft for monitoring and treating 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The system will 
provide treatment suggestions to patients via mobile 
phone text or pre-recorded voice messages.
Evolution of Mobile Technologies
Addressing future health needs will be facilitated by the development of mobile technologies and network 
expansion. The key technology trends in mobile technology continue to be the same trends that have char-
acterized technological progress for the past 40 years: miniaturization, greater speed, and cost reduction. 
These advances are reflected in mobile telephony by some of the advancement issues shown in Table 2. A 
greater range of services becomes possible with more uniform, faster, and more affordable broadband ac-
cess; greater access and coverage expands the ‘subscriber’ base, building volume, creating incentives for 
players, and helping push sustainable mHealth applications beyond simple one-way data services. ■

Sustainable and Scalable
Identifying the Building Blocks for Sustainable 
and Scalable mHealth Programs
Success can beget success in the field of mHealth if organizations enhance their opportunity to drive 
successful outcomes by learning from similar projects taking place within the mHealth ‘ecosystem.’ This 
section identifies mHealth projects that embody practices of highly scalable and sustainable mHealth 
programs. The case studies reveal some of the key benefits of mHealth, and provide examples of how 
to structure successful mHealth initiatives. These case studies also reflect the field’s dynamism, as each 
was implemented within the 12 months prior to the publication of this report.
Key Building Blocks for Success
As a young field, mHealth is well positioned to benefit from best practices and available technology 
documented in early project reports. The case studies of mHealth projects and input from industry 
experts reveal common practices that collectively form the building blocks for success in this young, 
dynamic field.
Forge strong partnerships
Partners from multiple sectors bring diverse strengths to the project. Ensuring that each part-
ner advances its organizational goals through the project paves the way for successful future 
collaborations.
Be accessible
Communication is more effective when tailored to specific social, ethnic, and demographic 
groups. Colloquial language and references to pop culture may be effective in reaching teen-
agers, while older populations may prefer a more formal approach.
Design with the end user in mind and maintain a focus on usability
Applications and devices must take the users work environment into account in the design 
phase. In the mHealth environment, ease of use is essential.
Build a long-term funding plan
Continuing the project beyond the initial seed funding can be accomplished by aligning with 
long-term national health goals. Integration with the national health care program of the coun-
try of operation is essential.
Set measurable goals
By setting interim goals and benchmarks, mHealth projects can provide proof of success, al-
lowing them to secure support and funding for expansion. Setting measurable goals also helps 
project principals to identify the need to quickly correct a particular course of action in the 
event that interim targets are not met.
Collaborate with other mHealth organizations
With dozens of projects currently operating, the mHealth field is now in a strong position to 
move forward by sharing techniques and applications. Organizations such as the Open Mobile 
Consortium are facilitating the ability of the field to move forward by sharing best practices.

Project Masiluleke
Country: South Africa
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: 
Praekelt Foundation, iTeach, National Geographic, Nokia Siemens Networks, MTN, Ghetto Ruff, Children of 
South African Legacies, Aricent, frog design and National AIDS Helpline
The Project 
Project Masiluleke sent three hundred and sixty five million text messages—one million per day—in 2008 to 
encourage people to be tested and treated for HIV/AIDS and TB. According to sponsor Pop!Tech, Project 
Masiluleke represents the largest use of mobile devices for the delivery of HIV/AIDS and TB information and 
treatment in South Africa, with the potential for future expansion to other countries. 
Project Masiluleke takes advantage of the popularity of ‘Please Call Me’ (PCM) services, which are widely 
used in South Africa and throughout Africa. These free text messages are used by individuals without phone 
credit to prompt recipients to call them. PCM messages contain the words ‘Please Call Me,’ and the phone 
number of the sender. The remaining 120-character spaces can be filled with advertising, but Project Masi-
luleke sponsor MTN is donating the space in one million messages each day to be used for HIV/AIDS and TB-
related information. The message content is provided by outreach and service organization iTeach.
Messages are written in local languages, and are used to direct recipients to the National AIDS Helpline. Once 
patients have called, representatives of the hotline provide information about testing services and locations.
Be Accessible
With many countries having multiple local and regional languages, communicating with 
people in the language they know best is critical. Similarly, it is essential to understand the 
target demographic. Colloquial language and references to pop culture may be effective in 
reaching teenagers, while older populations may prefer a more formal approach.
22 Identifying the Building Blocks for Sustainable and Scalable mHealth Programs
Objectives and Results
Project Masiluleke is designed to make more people aware of their HIV status because in South Africa, one-
quarter of the population is estimated to be infected with HIV, but less than 3% know their status. The broader 
goal of the program is to have those infected receive treatment and to halt the spread of the disease. Initial 
results from a beta test of the project indicated that it helped to nearly triple call volume to the helpline in the 
three weeks during which it ran. The project partners are building in rigorous monitoring and evaluation of the 
project by, for example, linking calls to the helpline to PCM text messages through the use of distinct phone 
numbers that allow organizers to verify the number of calls generated by the program. Once the project is 
operating successfully, the system will be expanded to provide information about TB resources and treatment.
Future Plans and Scaling Challenges
The next phases of the project will be the use and extension of the Praekelt Foundation’s TxtAlert program to 
remind HIV-positive patients to take their medication and keep medical appointments; the creation of ‘virtual’ 
call centers staffed by highly adherent patients; and the deployment of easy-to-use home HIV test kits, as the 
social stigma attached to HIV often prevents people from going to public clinics for testing. 
Challenges remain for scaling projects like Masiluleke. Working across multiple networks, developing relevant 
messaging, and catalyzing resources to take the initiative to scale are all difficult, according to Robin Miller of 
Praekelt Foundation. Yet the project’s early achievements point to some factors that increase the likelihood of 
success. Miller says that several ingredients have been critical for success:
■ Ensuring strong local partners to develop relevant content. Masiluleke’s partners enable 
the organization to tap into an already established customer base and also leverage their knowledge to 
build valuable content.
■ Method of interacting with the intended audience. “We have found that mobile phone innova-
tions already exist, even without new applications. For example, sending ‘missed calls’ led to the creation 
of the PCM message which was the starting point for the project.”
■ Scaling and progress are only possible through rigorous data collection and  
analysis.  Only through measurement can we know what is working and where redirection is needed.

Multiple Health Issues Addressed by SMS Campaigns
Netcare Vodacom Smile for You Campaign—Hundreds of thousands of children in the developing world are af-
flicted with the condition known as cleft lip and palate, a relatively common birth defect that is all but invisible in 
rich countries where surgery to correct it is widely available and affordable. Children who are not able to have 
this condition remedied through surgery often have eating and speech difficulties and face social discrimina-
tion. In 2007, the Netcare Group, a private medical hospital group in South Africa, and Vodacom teamed with 
the Praekelt Foundation to offer 50 free cleft lip and palate surgeries to children too poor to afford them. A 
previous campaign to raise awareness of this service had relied on traditional media such as print and radio 
but yielded disappointing results, with only about 12 candidates identified for the surgery.
For the Smile for You campaign, the sponsors shifted to a mobile technology solution to improve response 
levels. In South Africa, ‘Please Call Me’ (PCM) text messages, which mobile phone users can send for free with 
a request to the sender to call, have become an enormously popular service, and operators subsidize them 
through the sale of advertising space in the unused character space of the text message. Over the course of 
five days, Vodacom donated space in one million PCM text messages for a message asking recipients if they 
knew of children in need of free cleft lip and palate surgery, using Praekelt’s SocialTxt technology (also used in 
HIV/AIDS outreach efforts). During the first two days, recipients who wanted more information were prompted 
to phone a call center manned by Netcare staff. Beginning on the third day, recipients were given the option 
of sending an SMS with the word ‘SMILE’ to the Netcare call center, whereupon a representative would phone 
them to provide further information about the surgery offer (resulting in a lower cost to the message recipient).
The results of the campaign demonstrated the effectiveness of this concept. Calls made to the call 
center, which hovered in the single digits in the weeks before and after the campaign, 
averaged nearly 35 per day, while staff received over 355 text messages during the 
three days that responding via text message was an option. In all, 42 children were 
identified as surgery candidates, more than three times the number identified during a 
traditional media campaign lasting six weeks. The sponsors note that 203 people who did not know 
anyone with a cleft lip or palate responded, indicating that broadening the campaign to include languages 
other than English might yield even more promising results.
According to the Praekelt Foundation, several factors were essential to the campaign’s success. All of the 
partners involved in the project brought strengths to it, as well as a desire to rigorously track results. The will-
ingness to change tactics in the middle of the campaign also allowed the sponsors to compare communication 
methods in order to determine what was likely to work in future campaigns. And perhaps most critically, the 
partners leveraged the popularity of PCM messages and the experience Praekelt had accumulated in previous 
campaigns using SocialTxt software.

Text to Change (TTC)
Country: Uganda
Sponsoring Organization and Partners:  
Celtel, AIDs Information Centre (AIC), Merck, and the Dutch Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs
The Project 
Text to Change (TTC) provided HIV/AIDS awareness via an SMS-
based quiz to 15,000 mobile phone subscribers during three months in 
Uganda. TTC was founded with the goal of improving health education 
through the use of text messaging, which holds the advantages of anonymity and strong uptake among 
the population. Partnering with the mobile carrier Celtel and the local NGO AIDS Information Centre (AIC), 
TTC conducted a pilot program from February through April 2008 in the Mbarra region of Uganda, with the 
objective of increasing public knowledge of and changing behavior around AIDS. The program aimed to 
encourage citizens to seek voluntary testing and counseling for HIV/AIDS.
An SMS-based multiple choice quiz was administered to 15,000 Celtel mobile phone subscribers in the rural 
region of Mbarra. Free airtime was offered to users to encourage participation in the program; this was de-
termined to be a powerful incentive since users can exchange the airtime with other subscribers as a type 
of currency.
The quiz was interactive. When participants gave a wrong answer they received an SMS with the correct 
answer from the cell phone provider. The uptake rate of the survey was 17.4% and focused on two specific 
public health areas:
■ General knowledge about HIV transmission
■ The benefits of voluntary testing and counseling 
At the end of the quiz, a final SMS was sent to motivate participants to go for voluntary testing and coun-
seling at the local health center. Those who went to the center were asked a final question: Was this was 
the first time they had an HIV test? After testing, participants were requested to leave their mobile phone 
number so that post-test counseling could be arranged. For the people who came to the health centers 
through TTC, HIV testing and counseling was free of charge. Initial grants from Merck, the US pharmaceuti-
cal company, and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs supported the program launch.

Forge Strong Partnerships
Successful mHealth projects require the participation of partners with expertise in the fields of technology, 
healthcare, and academia. Validation and testing are key steps in the conception of mHealth programs and this 
phase typically occurs within a university setting or a technical organization. In order to move to the implementa-
tion stage, however, it is essential to bring other partners into the project. Dr. Patricia Mechael of the Earth Insti-
tute notes that “The projects that have been implemented at significant scale have forged strong partnerships, 
either with a government or a private corporation.” Mechael further affirms that the mHealth field currently finds 
itself in a place where a number of projects are in the design and testing phase that have not yet made the move 
to implementation. “As the diverse sectors involved in mHealth continue to collaborate and the corporate and 
political climate become more supportive we expect to see more projects move into the implementation phase.”
Identifying the Building Blocks for Sustainable and Scalable mHealth Programs 25
Set Measurable Goals
As with any initiative, setting measurable goals establish-
es the barometer that allows mHealth projects to assess 
success or failure. It builds in the rigor that is required if 
course corrections are needed during the project. Once 
achieved, these goals, in turn, form the building blocks 
for success, allowing the project to move forward with 
larger implementations and broader partnerships.

The quiz produced a 40% increase 
in patients who came in for 
testing—from 1,000 to 1,400 during 
a six-week period.
Objectives and Results
The quiz had two goals:
■ Collect information. In particular, the program was able to assess the rate of correct or incorrect answers 
within certain socio-economic sectors, and pass this information along to UNICEF.
■ Promote testing and counseling. The quiz notified participants of the location of the nearest testing 
center. If they stated that they were referred from the quiz, testing was free (there was normally a small 
charge for testing).
The quiz produced a 40% increase in patients who came in for testing—from 1,000 to 1,400 during a six-week 
period.
In terms of information gathering, a key finding of the survey was that although people were quite knowledge-
able about issues such as condom use, they did not think that AIDS testing was accurate or anonymous. This 
was a major finding, in that the population of Uganda had not been surveyed on this question before. TTC was 
able to pass this along to larger health agencies operating in the region, thereby contributing to the efficacy of 
existing health programs.
TTC co-founder Hajo van Beijma notes that “there was initially an element of risk for the funders since this 
type of project had not been conducted before, but now that we have proven results we have the opportu-
nity to expand.” TTC is planning a follow-up program in Uganda in January 2009. One of the goals of this next 
campaign is to promote the safety and effectiveness of the testing center, and therefore specifically encour-
age testing.
In this phase, collaboration with local partners will be further strengthened, with the local HIV/AIDS organiza-
tions submitting questions. Text to Change intends to shorten the duration of the program to four weeks, hop-
ing to minimize participant drop-out rates, and to include non-English speaking subscribers by enabling them 
to read SMS messages in their local languages.  
The pilot saw the sponsoring partners benefit as well: Celtel (now rebranded Zain) reaps benefits not only 
from a corporate social responsibility (CSR) perspective but also through the promotion of its texting service. 
The testing center increased the number of tests conducted, placing them in a position to receive expanded 
funding. 
26 Identifying the Building Blocks for Sustainable and Scalable mHealth Programs
Future Plans and Scaling Challenges
Hajo van Beijma hopes to build upon lessons learned from the pilot. He comments, “After the pilot we 
saw that our initial program didn’t have a good survey running. In the second round we developed a new 
survey with Ugandans, and used university students. Their IT knowledge is fabulous. They really know how 
to program these kinds of software tools in Uganda.”
The new program in January 2009 will target 30,000 people, and ultimately TTC plans to do a nationwide 
roll-out. Van Beijma notes, “If we are able to prove that we can send out a large number of questions, that 
will lay the groundwork for the nationwide program. In the first pilot there were some issues with being 
able to send out a large number of questions at the same time.”
Van Beijma cites several critical success factors for scaling Text to Change and similar mHealth projects. 
These include:
■ Develop surveys in the numerous local languages. This would make their message more 
accessible to specific ethnic and social groups. Literacy is also an issue. However, van Beijma notes, 
“If people do not speak or read English and they get a text message they will ask their neighbor what 
it means.” 
■ Secure ongoing funding. Though TTC is more cost effective than many other education pro-
grams, steady funding will allow for stable operations and growth.
■ Collaborate with other mHealth organizations. Van Beijma notes that one of the consen-
sus findings of the recent MobileActive conference in South Africa (October, 2008) is the need to 
set up a consortium to promote collaboration among mHealth organizations in different developing 
countries. “The goal is to work with organizations that are doing similar and complementary things in 
different countries. This way if we move into other countries we will combine strengths, for example, 
by developing software together.”

the spread of the dengue virus. Development of the software began in the first quarter of 2007 and it was 
piloted in different regions of Brazil during that same year. The Amazonas Health Department undertook the 
first full implementation of the solution, which began in October 2008.
Data Gathering allows the creation of customized questionnaires, which are distributed to the mobile phones 
of health agents in the field. When the field workers finish their surveys, they send the data back to the server 
via a wireless connection, from which it can be integrated into the organization’s existing systems for imme-
diate analysis. Data Gathering also provides GPS location information for each record, which would otherwise 
require dedicated instruments.
Users report the tool is flexible and easy to use. As Luzia de Melo Mustafa, an Amazonas health agent, af-
firms, “It’s easier, quicker and more practical. You type it and send it right away, it goes straight to the server. 
Then the data is consolidated and we can get the result immediately and, consequently, we may take the 
right actions, what we need to do. The devices are providing us with precision; the information we need to 
develop [effective responses] in the areas where the infection levels are high.”
Objectives and Results
The goals of the project are all about saving time to save lives. Andre, project principal, states “The initial 
impetus for the project started with a meeting in Brasilia with the federal Ministry of Health where we tried to 
find a way to use mobile technology to improve current health data surveys being conducted using pen and 
paper. There was a real need to make the process more agile and more reliable, providing the government 
with a tool that could ultimately save lives through the use of smartphones.”
Results of Data Gathering implementation to date are highly encouraging. The project team’s preliminary 
evaluation has shown that the time spent in data gathering was drastically reduced, and end-user accept-
ability has been very high so far. Even before the full implementation, more than 400 results were gathered 
during the tests by a team of 20 field professionals in the course of two days, all with GPS information. Luzia 
de Melo confirms, “Before we used to wait for one or two months before we could get all the consolidated 
information. Now, we have it on a daily basis.” As Greg Elphinston, Community Involvement Director for 
Nokia, elaborates, “If you have to wait two to three months for information in the health context, this can be 
the difference between life and death.”

Future Plans
Plans for expansion will be based on a comprehensive evaluation of current work. The immediate growth 
objective is to broaden the covered areas in the Amazonas state, as well as adding yellow fever and malaria 
to the list of diseases to be surveyed.
Project staff cite several critical success factors for Data Gathering and similar projects, including: 
■ Work closely with local and regional government agencies. The service must respond to 
the local needs as perceived by local officials. Their support for the project will make implementation and 
expansion possible.
■ Maintain a focus on usability. According to Andre Erthal, Head of Community Group at the Nokia 
Technology Institute, “If the field agents do not see the device as part of their work or have difficulties in 
using it, it may severely damage the overall success of the implementation. That is one of the reasons 
why the solution was developed since the beginning with the end user in mind, so we could develop the 
solution to be as user-friendly as possible.” 
■ Working in partnership with Nokia, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), and National Foundation 
for Indigenous Peoples’ Health (FUNASA), the UNF-VF Technology Partnership will be launching a pro-
gram called Mobisus in Brazil in 2009, utilizing mobile phones for health data gathering.13  
Design With the End User in Mind
“End-user acceptance is one of the critical success factors for the project. If the 
field agents do not see the device as part of their work or have difficulties in using 
it, it may severely damage the overall success of the implementation. That is one of 
the reasons why the solution was developed since the beginning with the end user 
in mind, so we could develop the solution to be as user-friendly as possible.”

Government Support is Critical for Long-term Success
 
The majority of mHealth projects are implemented with seed funding from philanthropic orga-
nizations such as foundations and multilateral institutions, or as part of a corporate social re-
sponsibility initiative by a for-profit business. The three case studies highlighted in this report 
provide proof of concept, and initial positive results. However, all too often, once the initial 
funding has been exhausted the projects find it difficult to achieve scalability and sustainabil-
ity, resulting in unintended termination. Ensuring long-term sustainability is a major challenge 
for mHealth projects. 
Expert researchers in the public health and eHealth arena are currently examining the 
sources of sustainability for mHealth projects. In particular, Dr. Adesina Iluyemi, a PhD Can-
didate at the University of Portsmouth, United Kingdom focusing on sustainable mHealth in 
developing countries, has noted that mHealth projects are far more likely to be sustainable in 
cases where buy-in from governmental or public bodies is secured. In this way, the project is 
institutionalized into existing government health programs and can receive budget attention.
Dr. Iluyemi notes, “It is very important that a mHealth project have the support of the national 
or regional government. The majority of mHealth projects are currently funded by interna-
tional agencies or CSR initiatives of companies. The problem is when the funding runs dry 
there is no more continuity. In the long term the custodian of the project will be the govern-
ment. This could be national, local, or regional. During the lifetime of the pilot project it is very 
important to ensure that the government buys in and that the government sees the benefit 
so that the project can survive beyond the donor-funded period.” For every mHealth project, 
therefore, it is critical to ensure that the program is aligned with the strategic goals of the 
national health system.

Identifying the Building Blocks for Sustainable and Scalable mHealth Programs 29
Open Source Movement: A Building Block for mHealth Success
A component of sustainability for mHealth programs is building capacity to enable programs to be locally 
implemented and maintained. The most successful mHealth projects have obviated the need for external 
consultants and achieved technical self-sufficiency. For many organizations, open source software is a tool 
for self-sufficiency, as it reduces costs, increases the available pool of programmers, and eliminates the need 
for outside consultants. It also encourages innovation. 
Software development costs can be reduced with open source software because there is no need to pur-
chase licenses. Because local programmers in developing countries are increasingly being trained in open 
source software, self-sufficiency is promoted. According to Dr. Balcha Masresha of the WHO, open source 
software is a key variable in the ability of EpiSurveyor, a PDA-based data collection project, to be sustainable 
and scale up to 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. “It is crucial for this kind of project because of existing 
longstanding experience with the EPIINFO software (freeware developed by the Centers for Disease Control) 
used in nearly all countries for the management of immunization and surveillance databases and analysis, 
and because of the inhibitive costs involved in the purchase of proprietary software for the average African 
user.”
As Eduardo Jezierski, Vice President of Engineering at InSTEDD states, “Open source allows different proj-
ects to ‘talk’ to each other. In this way we can pool our very limited engineering resources and say ‘here’s 
the source code, can you help me with this.’ It is allowing us to create a platform that costs less money from 
a licensing perspective for the countries running mHealth programs.” Jezierski further notes that “This indus-
try is at an early stage, and it is very encouraging that people are learning from each other and are sharing 
source code. It is very rare that an industry starts with this sort of collaboration.”
Collaborations of this nature are steadily emerging in the mHealth arena—witness the ‘Open Mobile’ Consor-
tium, which was conceived at the MobileActive08 conference in Johannesburg, South Africa in October 2008 
and began to take shape in a series of meetings in New York the following month. The organization will focus 
on developing best practices and standards for the mHealth field. Organizations of this type will pave the way 
for coordinating the various components of mHealth on a grander scale, bringing the industry to a higher 
stage of evolution. ■
“It is crucial for this kind of project because of existing longstanding

and analysis, and because of the inhibitive costs involved in the 
purchase of proprietary software for the average African user.”
OpenROSA
 
With so many community-based organizations involved in creating mHealth applications and a need for 
both customization and standardization, it is not surprising that many applications are created in an open 
source framework. With this in mind, a coalition of community health organizations and health researchers 
created OpenROSA in 2007. OpenROSA is a consortium that develops “open source, standards-based tools 
for mobile data collection, aggregation, analysis, and reporting.” With university partners in the United States 
providing technical expertise and community health professionals in Africa testing and deploying mobile ap-
plications in the field, multiple organizations are able to share their ideas, data, code, and experiences. 
As part of this effort, OpenROSA is currently developing JavaROSA, a J2ME implementation intended to 
run on mobile phones and PDAs. One of the programs using this architecture is CommCare, which is being 
tested in Tanzania and Uganda by community health workers collecting health data in rural areas. The pro-
gram was designed to maximize patient data security while remaining simple for workers to use, a difficult 
balancing act. Participants in the project hope that as CommCare is deployed, it will not only provide better 
data and improved patient care and service where it is used, but that the lessons from field experience will 
help perfect the architecture for future projects.
30 Assessing mHealth and Future Health Needs in Developing Countries
Incentives

Understanding the Incentives for Multiple 
Players: mHealth Value Chain
One of the most crucial building blocks for successful and sustainable mHealth programs is to forge strong 
partnerships, particularly across sectors (for-profit, non-profit and public sector). A solid understanding of 
the needs and interests of these multiple players is required in order to marshal their energy and resources. 
One method of identifying these incentives is through value chain analysis, or an evaluation of the relationship 
between all organizations and steps in the commercialization or delivery process of a product or service. The 
diverse players—spanning from the patient to the equipment vendor—in the mHealth value chain are listed in 
Table 3.
Value Chain Models for mHealth: One-way Data Applications
Figure 5 illustrates the most basic set of relationships and players for mHealth solutions based on a one-
way messaging application. Examples of this type of application include medication regimen adherence and 
monitoring programs (e.g., SIMpill, which equips pill bottles with a SIM card and transmitter to track medica-
tion adherence) and education and support programs based on one- or two-way SMS alerts (FrontlineSMS, 
a platform for sending and receiving group SMS messages; MyQuestion/MyAnswer, providing education on 
HIV/AIDS via SMS communications). Figure 5 depicts the dynamics and incentives described in Table 3.
Player Incentive
Patient or Citizen (Mobile Subscriber) Improved health outcomes
Health Care Provider More efficient and effective delivery of health services
NGO Advance organizational mission, attract funding
Foundations Advance organizational mission
Government More efficient health care provision, effective government
Equipment Provider Device revenue generation, improved brand recognition
Service Provider Revenue from service fees, increased subscriber base
Application Solutions Provider Revenue from additional applications license fees
Content Management Increase in volume of readership or revenue
Platform Provider Revenue from sales
Table 3. mHealth value chain players and incentives.
Understanding the Incentives for Multiple Players: mHealth Value Chain Understanding the Incentives for Multiple Players: mHealth V3a1lue Chain
Considerations about project scale are crucial in planning for long-term project sustainability. Scale is a prin-
cipal factor in the incentive structure of many value chain participants. For example, it is unlikely that project 
leaders will be able to obtain ongoing funding for special device modifications or customized features for small 
local initiatives, since there is not enough volume to warrant contributions from the platform developer without 
prohibitive development and maintenance fees. On the other hand, a basic ‘one-way’ messaging service can 
be an attractive investment even at low volumes, as it significantly reduces costs and improves efficiencies for 
health care providers, enabling the phase-out of cumbersome manual processes.
However, at higher levels of scale, a program can represent strategic growth for the larger value chain par-
ticipants (those on the left side of Figure 5). Partnerships that are rooted in the business interests of for-profit 
participants have an intrinsic value beyond corporate social responsibility (CSR) and, therefore, are less at risk 
of being cut off during a downturn in the participant’s overall business.

Figure 6. Value chain model for ‘two-way’ mHealth applications.
Value Chain Models for mHealth: Two-Way Data Applications
Figure 6 presents a value chain model for a more complex service offering—a two-way data application. 
Two-way applications are developed for data access programs such as remote data collection, access to 
client records, access to health information databases, census taking, and electronic health records cre-
ation and storage (e.g., EpiSurveyor, a survey program for remote data collection). While it is not likely that 
two-way services will have the volume potential of one-way services, these services appeal to potential 
participants because they are Internet-based. Participants in the value chain may find incentive to integrate 
mHealth solutions with growth plans around Internet access, as it is an established functionality on both 
phones and laptops and the basis for other services (and thus revenue opportunities). 
The complexity evident in Figure 6 creates opportunities for innovative health solutions, but also a number of 
challenges, including increased dependence on information technology (IT) infrastructure, the need for more 
sophisticated application development, greater support service requirements, and a more expensive hard-
ware component. These higher-level solutions entail higher project cost and participant involvement, which 
in some cases may be prohibitive.
With more value chain participants and higher costs of execution, there is less reward (whether in the form 
of revenue gains or operational efficiencies) to go around. It therefore becomes progressively more difficult 
to achieve the financial impact that provides momentum and leads to partnership with larger players. These 
companies’ contributions to the more ambitious initiatives, therefore, will likely be limited to the provision of 
standard services or as a one-off CSR project. ■

A Call for Action
The mHealth field offers opportunities for players across multiple sectors, from governments to businesses 
to NGOs. By taking a strategic approach, each of these players can advance their organizational objectives 
while contributing to improved health outcomes on a massive scale.
Operators
Combine mHealth with delivery of other mServices
Operators can capitalize on the popularity of mServices in developing countries to build support for mHealth 
initiatives. Rapidly growing mServices such as mBanking and mCommerce are proving the viability of mobile 
technology as a service model. Packaging such services with mHealth solutions creates economies for 
operators and takes advantage of shared resources and best practices. It also presents a more compelling 
proposition to end users by serving as a ‘one-stop shop’ for all their needs.
Leverage handset maker relationships
Mobile operators have tremendous influence and strong relationships with handset manufacturers, and they 
should leverage this position to bring to market phones and other devices that can provide the mHealth and 
other mobile services consumers in developing countries need. Affordability is critical, yet not sufficient to 
significantly increase the usage of mServices across the developing world. Low-cost phones that incorpo-
rate simple, innovative features are key to increasing access to mServices and helping to create the scale 
and market needed to sustain them over the long run.
34 A Call for Action
Be pro-active in developing joint solutions
Operators would do well to pro-actively seek out opportunities to improve health outcomes by initiating  
public-private partnerships, teaming up with governments and NGOs to address pressing national health  
issues, and collaborating with software providers to develop targeted healthcare solutions. Joint projects help 
ensure that key stakeholders are on board, increasing the potential for successful outcomes. 
Enhance mHealth infrastructure
Infrastructure conditions vary in the developing world, and operator services geared toward mHealth can 
enhance their networks to facilitated increased mHealth activity. As Eduardo Jezierski, Vice President of Engi-
neering at InsteDD notes, “From a technical perspective you need to think not just about use of your network 
as a way for humans to communicate with humans but also as a way for humans to communicate with sys-
tems and information. The challenge is to build better application gateways that allow for different organiza-
tions involved in mHealth to build the applications themselves. 
For best results, think big and join forces
Think big. As Jesse Moore of the GSMA states, “Scale is of utmost importance to mobile operators. Opera-
tors evaluate value-added services, such as mHealth applications, by volume and volume is measured in mil-
lions of users, not hundreds or thousands. Scale is evaluated on three dimensions: how easy is the service to 
use by the end users? How easy is it to install and maintain on the operator’s network and how many hand-
sets can use the service (many handsets in Africa are very basic and hence the service must be designed for 
simple handsets). Without scale, the mHealth application will be evaluated as a corporate social responsibility 
initiative and its sustainability will be in question.”
Partner
The most effective approach to 
achieving scale is to join forces 
with companies that are already 
offering mServices (mobile money, 
mobile government services, Design With the End User in Mind
mobile education), and propose 
a joint effort on mHealth. NGOs Operators

A Call for Action 35
Provide proof of concept by using the simplest available technology 
Many operational mHealth programs build on the broad use of standard cell phones. Early applications pro-
vide data access and exchange in the form of one-way or basic two-way services. The infrastructure for these 
applications is already in place through standard telecommunications networks, and, unlike more complicated 
devices such as PDAs, users have widely embraced the functionality. These simple applications thus have 
the distinct advantages of lower start-up and operating costs and broader reach, pointing to a clearer path 
toward financial sustainability.
Policymakers
Define an mHealth policy and provide incentives 
Define what mHealth means within the national health system. mHealth applications can be designed as an 
integral part of the overall health information system, and policymakers are in a unique position to shape these 
efforts. One of the most important roles to play in this regard is in driving innovation through incentives. Incen-
tives can include tax rebates to telecom providers for provision of mHealth services, and funding for universi-
ties and research institutes studying mHealth solutions.
Funders
Provide resources for impact assessment
Help grantees help themselves. Non-profit and international development funding sources are placing a grow-
ing emphasis on ‘demonstrable impact.’ As such, mHealth proposals and programs need to be able to specify 
and measure program success. This is even more critical given the early stage of the mHealth market and 
the attendant absence of a body of research to which program managers can refer. To mitigate this problem, 
funders can set aside funds to enable independent researchers to conduct rigorous evaluations of mHealth 
programs.
Ensure project sustainability
Partner with national governments once the initial pilot phase has been completed. By ensuring that mHealth 
projects are integrated into government health programs, funders gain long-term sustainability and greater 
health impacts for their projects. Academic researchers affirm the central role of long-term financial planning: 
Dr. Adesina Ilyumi of the University of Portsmouth states, “Foundations should incorporate sustainable busi-
ness/financial models beyond donor funding into their strategic plan, and engage with government bodies at 
the level of implementation in order to ensure that the project continues beyond the seed funding.” ■
“In today’s mHealth environment there’s a general tendency to try and seek out 
solutions to the bigger health problems. Easier ‘low-hanging fruit’ are often 
overlooked. Enhancing basic communications within rural healthcare networks 
is a classic low-hanging fruit…Communication is fundamental to all NGO 
activities, particularly those working in the kinds of infrastructure-challenged 
environments often found in the developing world. Hospital staff often lack basic 
communication with their community healthcare workers…creating considerable 
inefficiencies in the use and allocation of scarce resources. We need to ensure 
that we address some of the simpler mHealth challenges…in parallel with our 
search for solutions to what we consider to be more complex problems.”

Conclusion: Looking Forward
The field of mHealth is at an inflection point. With dozens of projects implemented and proven benefits, all 
trends indicate that investment will continue and mHealth projects will serve an ever wider range of constitu-
ents in the years ahead. At the same time, technological innovations will bring enhanced benefits, particu-
larly in the areas of data collection, patient monitoring, and remote diagnostic and treatment support, where 
application development is already proceeding at breakneck speed. 
Health needs in the developing world are rapidly evolving to include chronic diseases, in addition to the 
communicable diseases most often associated with developing countries. mHealth is well-positioned to ad-
dress these challenges using currently available technology. For example, SMS alerts can be equally useful 
in raising public health awareness of HIV/AIDS and in ensuring patient adherence to treatments for chronic 
diseases such as diabetes. Emerging technologies, such as wide-area wireless systems, will also be an as-
set in tackling today’s health challenges and those of tomorrow.
As this paper has shown, mHealth projects are operating in a wide variety of developing countries and 
providing demonstrable impacts. Documented results—in both the developed and developing world—reveal 
that mobile technology improves the efficiency of healthcare delivery. The next stage in the evolution of 
the mHealth field is to increase the scope and scale of operations. By learning from examples of similar 
projects, mHealth organizations will enhance their opportunity to scale and increase their health impact. 
Case studies detailed in this paper reveal some of the key benefits of mHealth and provide examples of 
how to structure successful mHealth initiatives. These studies also reveal key building blocks of success for 
mHealth projects, such as forging strong partnerships and designing with the end user in mind.
Conclusion: Looking Forward Understanding the Incentives for Multiple Players: mHealth V3a7lue Chain
The transformational power of mobile networks and devices is helping drive the adoption of scalable and sus-
tainable health initiatives, particularly in the developing world.  To move forward, leading players in the field of 
mHealth agree that multi-stakeholder collaboration on a global level is needed.  
Due to its nascent stage, mHealth presents a tremendous opportunity to create a global facilitation body, 
enabling maximum innovation and impact on global health.  There is an agreement among participants in 
this arena on the need for a body to address the many informational and logistical gaps in the mHealth eco-
systems; from basic market research to best practices; from policy engagement and standards advocacy; to 
support scalable implementations of mHealth pilot programs through public-private partnerships.
An alliance cultivating the cross-sectoral and pan regional partnerships and projects necessary to expand the 
existing embryonic mHealth ecosystem would be a significant step in enabling closer collaboration on mHealth 
initiatives by multi-sectoral organizations.
The long-term goal and expectation underlying all these efforts is that mHealth programs will have a significant 
and lasting positive impact on health outcomes such as reduced infant mortality, longer life spans, and de-
creased contraction of disease. This report is designed to move the field one step further in the achievement of 
this ambitious goal by outlining the current state of the field, highlighting mHealth initiatives taking root around 
the globe, and outlining the building blocks required for successful and sustainable mHealth initiatives. ■

Application Area: Education and Awareness
Communicating information in an engaging, fun way is a critical ingredient of success in mHealth programs. 
The Freedom HIV/AIDS games—launched in India in December 2005—have effectively enhanced HIV/AIDS 
awareness by applying this principle. The games are tailored to target users from different social and demo-
graphic groups and run on more than 100 types of mobile phones, from the most basic to the most sophisti-
cated. ZMQ Software Systems, the maker of the games, believes the “Play-and-Learn method [the games  
employ]…makes learning not only exciting and engaging but helps in the enhancement and retention of 
knowledge.” This belief has been confirmed by the games’ popularity: by March 2006, only four months af-
ter the launch date, more than ten million games had been downloaded, many by mobile phone subscribers 
in small cities and towns, the most vulnerable populations.

MTN Foundation and Federal Ministry of Education and Federal Ministry of Health, Nigeria
Application Area: Education and Awareness
mHealth programs that take a holistic approach to public health challenges often have the best chance of 
success. Learning about Living, a collaborative pilot program, does this by providing young Nigerians with 
an anonymous forum to learn about health, AIDS, sex, relationships, personal development, and living skills. 
The program includes an interactive eLearning tool based on the Nigerian Family Life and HIV/AIDS Edu-
cation (FLHE) curriculum, as well as the mobile phone-based programs MyQuestion and MyAnswer. With 
MyQuestion, Nigerian youth can submit questions via text message, a telephone hotline, or online. Ques-
tions are promptly answered by trained volunteers. MyAnswer sends out a monthly question (e.g., what is 
the difference between HIV and AIDS?) and selects winners based on responses submitted via the web or 
text message. The two-year project, launched in February 2007, was piloted in three locations in Nigeria, 
and saw early success. The service received more than 2,500 questions in the first five days and received 
10,000 questions in the first month.

Education and Awareness
Project 3: HIV/AIDS Video Distribution by Mobile Phone
Country: Georgia
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: Save the Children and UNICEF
Application Area: Education and Awareness
HIV/AIDS receives little attention in regions such as the Caucasus, where the topic is taboo and many peo-
ple are uninformed about the disease and its causes. Save the Children and UNICEF collaborated in Janu-
ary 2008 to produce a 20-minute film about HIV/AIDS aimed at educating young people in Georgia. The film 
content is compelling, featuring well-known young actors who portray the potential health risks of everyday 
decisions and behaviors. Taking advantage of the popularity of mobile phones among young Georgians, 
Save the Children and UNICEF converted the film into a format that is viewable on mobile phones, at which 
point it was sent to thousands of young people around the country, who were encouraged to pass it on to 
friends. The project was praised for its novelty and the ease of dissemination. This innovative social distri-
bution model for health information had never been used in Georgia before, but is sure to be replicated in 
future initiatives.

Project 4: HIV Confidant 
Country: South Africa
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: Dimagi, Inc. (privately held software company)
Application Area: Education and Awareness
In places where HIV-positive status remains a stigma, successful outreach efforts must address people’s 
privacy and confidentiality concerns. The HIV Confidant project aims to encourage HIV/AIDS testing by 
ensuring secure distribution of test results through the use of handheld computers and standard encryp-
tion techniques. Dimagi, a US-based software company, implemented the HIV Confidant project in 2003 at 
the Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies in South Africa. In the pilot, 45,000 adults were tested 
for HIV, and results were shared with participants through a secure PDA-based system. People who were 
tested were provided with a unique ID code, and results were given only to those who provided the code. 
The HIV Confidant system runs on Palm m500 and Handspring Visor PDAs, but can be adapted for non-
Palm devices for greater flexibility and extended reach.

Project 7: Cell-PREVEN
Country: Peru
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (Peru), Imperial 
College (London), University of Washington (Seattle) and Peru’s Ministry of Health
Application Area: Remote Data Collection
When it comes to effective data collection in remote areas of the developing world, less is often more. 
Cell-PREVEN was created to allow access to real-time data to members of the healthcare ecosystem in 
Peru. This interactive voice response system enables health workers in the field to collect and transmit data 
via basic mobile phones. The data is aggregated in a centralized database and made available to medical 
professionals, and the system is designed to send SMS or e-mail alerts if certain symptoms are recorded. 
During a three-month pilot test, 797 reports were collected and 374 adverse events were recorded—30 
severe enough to trigger an SMS alert to a team leader. The pilot researchers believe that Cell-PREVEN 
demonstrates that “cell phones are a feasible means of collecting and reporting data in real-time in remote 
communities…it’s not necessary to have the latest Palm Pilot or Tablet PC to create a sophisticated public 
health surveillance system.”

Project 8: Community Accessible and Sustainable Health System (Ca:sh) 
Country: India
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: Media Lab Asia (part of the Ministry of ICT India), Dimagi, Inc. 
(privately-held software company) and All India Institute of Medical Sciences
Application Area: Remote Data Collection 
Large, rural areas in developing countries often lack comprehensive collection of health and population data. 
In Ballabhgarh, India, Media Lab Asia community health workers used an open source software application on 
PDAs called Ca:sh—the Community Accessible and Sustainable Health system—to collect medical and demo-
graphic data. The pilot aimed to improve maternal and child health, and used Compaq iPAQs, which could run 
a MySQL database capable of storing up to 7,000 records. An evaluation of the five-month pilot “indicated high 
acceptance of the technology and reduction in total time for entry of data…the [health workers] were satisfied 
with the user interface and were able to depend entirely on the handheld, replacing their existing paper-based 
records.” Media Lab Asia now is exploring future applications, such as mobile surveys and disease-case man-
agement, and has ported the software to less expensive Palm OS-based devices.

Project 9: Community Health Information Tracking System (CHITS)
Country: Philippines
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and Asia-Pacific 
Development Program (APDP)
Application Area: Remote Data Collection
Patient education is not the only challenge to improv-
ing health in the developing world—often health work-
ers are not equipped with the information they need 
to best serve patients. The Community Health Infor-
mation Tracking System, or CHITS, is an open source 
program that helps to ‘train the trainers’ by facilitating 
data collection and transmission in rural areas. The 
system allows community health workers to send 
SMS messages to report injuries and receive training 
on health surveillance via their mobile phones. The 
CHITS open source community believes they should 
teach local health workers “how to use the informa-
tion system, [and] allow them to gain insight into their 
condition…so that they can decide to take action and 
be proactive in empowering others to do the same.” 
Like many mHealth projects, CHITS had found that 
empowering local communities with information and 
enabling two-way data flows is an effective strategy.

Project 10: The Dokoza System 
Country: South Africa
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: Dokoza, State Information Technology Agency (SITA), 
Centre for Public Service Innovation (CPSI), Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the 
Meraka Institute, with the cooperation of South Africa’s National Department of Health
Application Area: Remote Data Collection 
Integrating mobile data collection solutions with existing health information systems is essential to advancing 
patient care. The Dokoza system in South Africa seeks to meet this need. It is an SMS-based mobile system 
designed to fast-track and improve critical services to HIV/AIDS and TB patients. Dokoza relies on SIM 
cards that can be used across networks, which interact with a more complex back-end system that inte-
grates with existing hospital information systems. The integration with existing infrastructure offers the pos-
sibility of dramatic improvements to existing patient health information records, and in the 2004 pilot, both 
doctors and patients found the system to be user-friendly. Challenges encountered during the pilot include 
the duplication of data entry in instances where paper-based systems already existed, and staff shortages 
that hampered information collection. Despite the promise of this technology, little new data exists on its 
impact since the end of the pilot.

Project 11: EpiHandy
Country: Uganda, Zambia, Burkina Faso
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: Center for International Health, Norway
Application Area: Remote Data Collection 
Health data collection in the developing world is often hampered by the high costs and inefficiencies of 
traditional large-scale paper-based surveys. The EpiHandy tool, a mobile health data collection and record 
access program enabled by PDAs, helps to mitigate these issues. EpiHandy has been deployed in many 
countries and by many different organizations since its first release in 2003, and has been used in multi-
year studies in Uganda, Zambia, and Burkina Faso. In the Uganda study, mobile phones were deployed to 
participating clinics and Ministry of Health experts trained the local staff on using the open source JavaRosa 
software to fill and submit medical forms. The data from the forms was transmitted across the standard ser-
vices available on the local mobile network. EpiHandy has yielded positive results during a five-year assess-
ment in which 14 interviewers collected information on breastfeeding habits and child anthropometry in rural 
areas of eastern Uganda. Outcomes include greatly reduced data entry errors and broad user acceptance, 
as well as cost effectiveness relative to traditional paper-based surveys, increasing the potential for this 
already successful solution to scale further.

Project 12: EpiSurveyor
Country: Kenya, Uganda, Zambia (and 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa by end of 2008)
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: The United Nations Foundation and Vodafone Foundation 
Technology Partnership, the World Health Organization and DataDyne
Application Area: Remote Data Collection 
A lack of health data is among the greatest obstacles facing health decision makers. One of the largest and 
most heralded mHealth projects, EpiSurveyor, developed by non-profit software provider DataDyne, enables 
public health and development professionals to create, share, and deploy health surveys and other forms 
on mobile devices. The program runs on free and open software, is easy to use, and can be downloaded 
to handheld devices to be used by workers in the field. Successful pilot programs in two countries result-
ed in more timely and accessible healthcare data, making it easier to strengthen district level healthcare 
programs like immunizations and responses to disease outbreaks. An added benefit is that country health 
workers become fully self-sufficient in programming, designing, and deploying health surveys, eliminating 
the need to contract outside consultants. Building upon the success of the initial programs, in fall 2008 the 
partners announced that with the financial backing of the United Nations Foundation and Vodafone Founda-
tion, and the scaling and expertise of the WHO and participating ministries of health, the EpiSurveyor-based 
mHealth program would be rolled out in a further 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

Project 13: Integrated Healthcare Information Service Through Mobile 
Telephony (IHISM)
Country: Botswana
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: Microsoft Research Digital Inclusion Program and the 
University of Botswana
Application Area: Remote Data Collection
In those developing countries boasting near-saturation of mobile phones, the potential benefits of mHealth 
strategies are the greatest. Microsoft and the University of Botswana are taking advantage of mobile tele-
phony’s broad reach in the country to develop an Integrated Healthcare Information Service (IHISM). The 
system serves both health workers and the general public. It uses a mobile phone-based software applica-
tion to allow health workers to capture, store, process, transmit, and access patient records. This results 
in lower costs and greater efficiency by eliminating redundancy and reducing the amount of time devoted 
to data input. The public can also turn to IHISM for information: individuals pose frequently asked questions 
about HIV/AIDS via SMS messages and receive a reply straight to their mobile phones. The project partners 
have identified several challenges, including localization and customization for illiterate users, but overall feel 
that the system has the potential to become a valuable tool and take on increased scope.

Project 14: Media Lab Asia – Shared Resource for Rural Health 
Management and Information Infrastructure 
Country: India
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: Media Lab Asia (part of the Ministry of ICT, India)
Application Area: Remote Data Collection 
The immense size of India, coupled with the fact that approximately 70% of its one billion citizens live in rural 
areas, makes affordable and flexible health data collection techniques a necessity. India’s Media Lab Asia 
is working on a project—Shared Resource for Rural Health Management and Information Infrastructure—to 
improve health data collection and analysis to better serve the needs of its citizens. The mHealth compo-
nent of this project is focused on data collection. Health workers will use handheld devices to collect a wide 
array of data in the field—medical history, demographics, immunizations, and instances of disease. This data 
will be transmitted from the devices to the health information system database, where it can be accessed 
on a real-time basis. The solution will be implemented initially in the Mallapuram District of Kerala in India. No 
exact dates for project implementation have been published.

Project 15: Mobile-Based Primary Healthcare Management System
Country: India
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: Center for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC)
Application Area: Remote Data Collection 
Primary Health Centers are critical in rural India as they provide direct patient care and link patients to the 
national health system via referrals. The Center for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) is devel-
oping a ‘Mobile-Based Primary Healthcare Management System’ to strengthen primary health centers in 
both rural areas and urban slums in India. The CDAC was created in 1988 and is a research and develop-
ment society overseen by India’s Department of Information and Ministry of Communications and Informa-
tion Technology. A key component of the Mobile-Based Primary Healthcare Management System will be 
an SMS-based interface, which will allow patients to transmit information to or receive information from a 
central database via a basic mobile phone. Medical staff and health officials will be able to access this data-
base from more sophisticated, web-enabled mobile phones. The project is in the development stage, but is 
expected to have a broad geographic scope.

Project 16: Map of Medicine for Kijabe Hospital
Country: Kenya
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: UK National Health Service (NHS), Cisco’s Internet 
Business Solutions Group (IBSG)
Application Area: Remote Data Collection
Doctors in rural areas are often forced to treat individual patients with little or no information about resourc-
es in neighboring areas, impeding them from providing optimum care. A joint project was launched in Kenya 
in 2006 to address this problem. The project gives Kenyan health workers at Kijabe Hospital access to the 
Map of Medicine, a medical information database. The Map of Medicine is a web-based tool that provides 
comprehensive, up-to-date information on diagnosis and treatment, presented in easy-to-use flowcharts or 
‘care pathways.’ Doctors participating in the pilot study were given PDAs and access to data on HIV/AIDS, 
TB, malaria, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and typhoid fever. Results were promising: hospital staff reported that 
the data access and entry via the PDAs has led to greater efficiency, more time with patients, and reduced 
administrative costs.

Project 18: PDAs for Malaria Monitoring
Country: Mozambique
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: AED-SATELLIFE
Application Area: Remote Data Collection 
Malaria is the prime cause of morbidity and mortality in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Prevention and treat-
ment of the disease are essential to reducing its effects on the population, and the rapid capture of ac-
curate information is a key part of these efforts. The PDAs for Malaria Monitoring project, based in Mo-
zambique, deploys PDAs and GPS devices to increase the ability of health workers implementing malaria 
programs to make informed decisions. The workers use the devices to collect data and transmit it via the 
GPRS network to a central database. A technical team then maps the geographic data to public health and 
resource information. Despite some technical challenges, the results of the project have been positive. Us-
ers are able to use the PDAs without difficulty, new data tools and training programs have been created, 
and information gathered has helped the Health Ministry to influence and shift the allocation of resources.

Country: Rwanda
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: The GSMA Development Fund, the U.S. President’s 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), Accenture Development Partnerships, Motorola, MTN and 
Voxiva
Application Area: Remote Data Collection 
Most mHealth programs strive to leverage the growth and penetration of mobile phones in developing 
countries to strengthen health systems and improve health outcomes. Phones for Health, a large public- 
private partnership, is pursuing this goal using a system developed and deployed by Voxiva at health 
ministries in Peru, India, and Rwanda. The program enables health workers in local communities to use a 
standard handset equipped with a downloadable application to collect and enter health data. Once the data 
is entered and transmitted, it can be integrated into health information systems and accessed by health of-
ficials in real time at all levels using the Internet. The system also allows workers to order medicines, send 
public health alerts, and download treatment guidelines. The Rwanda pilot follows the successful deploy-
ment of a related system—TRACnet—that manages the country’s HIV/AIDS program. Rollouts are planned 
for other areas of the health sector in Rwanda and other African countries.

Country: Rwanda
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: TRAC (Treatment and Research AIDS Center)—an 
institution of the Ministry of Health of Rwanda, Voxiva and the US Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC)
Application Area: Remote Data Collection 
TRACnet is a comprehensive data entry, storage, access, and sharing system created in Rwanda in 2005 
by the Treatment and Research AIDS Center (TRAC), part of the Rwandan Ministry of Health. The system is 
used to manage critical information on HIV/AIDS patients and monitor anti-retroviral treatment (ART) pro-
grams nationwide. Medical personnel can use TRACnet to monitor drug distribution, create and submit re-
ports electronically, and access the most up-to-date information on HIV/AIDS care and treatment. TRACnet 
was designed for use with all types of technology and information systems, but today, 90% of the system’s 
users access it via mobile phones, rather than more expensive and less reliable computers and Internet 
connections. Results of the gradual deployment and development of TRACnet have been promising. By the 
end of 2005, 21 medical centers had switched from inefficient paper-based systems to TRACnet’s electronic 
records system. By 2007, TRACnet covered all 168 health facilities that provide ART treatment, and there 
were plans to extend the system to 400 more health facilities. Rwanda’s Ministry of Health also hopes to 
expand the system to cover other chronic illnesses.

Project 21: The Cell-Life Project
Country: South Africa
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: The University of Cape Town, the Cape Peninsula University 
of Technology and Cell-Life
Application Area: Remote Monitoring
Providing home-based care for HIV/AIDS is critical in the African context, where the stigma attached to the 
disease often discourages patients from visiting health facilities. Cell-Life, a social enterprise based in South 
Africa, is developing innovative approaches to home care with their ‘Aftercare’ program. In this program, Af-
tercare health workers monitor patients whom they visit at home. Workers use data-enabled mobile phones 
to record information about the patients’ medical status, medication adherence, and other relevant factors. 
The data are then transmitted via SMS to the central Cell-Life database, where care managers use a web-
based system to access and monitor incoming patient information. Initial program results were encourag-
ing, but significant challenges remain. Although South Africa’s mobile penetration rate is high, the system is 
currently used on only one network using prepaid accounts, and the software is not yet available in any of 
South Africa’s national languages other than English. Cell-Life is currently working to address these issues 
so the program can be adopted on a national scale.

Application Area: Remote Monitoring
Economic development and the resultant lifestyle changes are contributing to rapidly rising diabetes rates in 
fast-growing nations such as China. To counter this trend, Microsoft Research and a group of researchers 
from several universities and Chinese medical centers are developing a smartphone-based self-manage-
ment and support system for elderly diabetics in China. The project will use smartphones to send elderly 
diabetics recommendations and guidelines related to physical activity, glucose and blood pressure monitor-
ing, weight measurement, and diet. Patients will be trained to enter and send data on glucose levels, and 
doctors will be able to track patient data and graphically display data for patients. The system designers will 
use a user-centered design approach to develop software that reflects the preferences and capabilities of 
the targeted population to achieve maximum usability. The project’s software will be available free of charge 
and will work on PDAs and smartphones that run the Windows Mobile operating system.

Project 23: Colecta-PALM
Country: Peru
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: The University of Washington, the Peruvian University of 
Cayetano Heredia and two Peruvian health clinics (Via Libre and Impacta)
Application Area: Education and Awareness, Remote Monitoring 
Patient-based mHealth strategies must have patient buy-in to succeed. Colecta-PALM, an open source, 
secure web-based application that delivers Spanish-language surveys via audio on PDAs, was designed to 
ensure patient buy-in. A pilot test of this technology was conducted with HIV/AIDS patients in Peru. The pa-
tients used PDAs to enter and submit information regarding their ART adherence and behaviors that could 
potentially lead to additional HIV transmission. Patients’ medicine compliance and behaviors were assessed 
and different types of feedback were provided depending on the user’s risk profile. Of the 31 patients 
tested, 27 (74%) reported openness to using PDAs for HIV treatment support. The researchers in this study 
believe that these results “suggest that PDAs may be a culturally appropriate way to support ART adher-
ence and safer sex for PLWHA [people living with HIV/AIDS]. Use of tools such as PDAs among PLWHA in 
some resource-constrained settings may be acceptable and can build on existing use patterns.”

Project 24: Mashavu: Networked Health Solutions for the Developing 
World 
Country: Tanzania
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: Pennsylvania State University and Ideablob.com
Application Area: Remote Monitoring 
Lack of sustained, regular care for children is often responsible for the spread of preventable diseases in 
the developing world. The ‘Mashavu: Networked Health Solutions for the Developing World’ project was 
initiated by students at Pennsylvania State University to tackle this challenge through mobile solutions. 
Mashavu (which means ‘chubby-cheeked’ in Swahili) is a computer-based system that enables doctors 
to connect with children in developing countries via mobile phones. Essential medical data (e.g., height, 
weight, blood pressure, and lung capacity) are collected at Mashavu stations in developing communities 
and sent by mobile phone to a remote server. Medical professionals can then ‘electronically adopt’ children 
by logging on to a web portal to monitor the children’s health, provide feedback or advice to the child’s 
caregivers, and collect health statistics. The student team from Pennsylvania State University is working with 
the Mount Meru Peak School and Good Hope orphanage in northern Tanzania to pilot test the system.

Project 25: MediNet Healthcare Management System 
Country: Trinidad and Tobago
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: Microsoft Research and University of the West Indies 
Application Area: Remote Monitoring
The Caribbean is a region with very poor healthcare facilities, but a comparatively strong cellular phone 
infrastructure. Microsoft Research has provided a grant to professors at the University of the West Indies to 
create a mobile phone-based healthcare management system, to be deployed first in Trinidad and Tobago, 
followed by a broader regional rollout. The long-term goal is to build a network that integrates medical re-
sources and promotes the sharing of medical information and expertise. The healthcare management sys-
tem, ‘MediNet,’ will target diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The system is designed to relay information 
from patient monitoring devices to a central server via a cellular network. At the server, a data reasoning 
engine extracts all relevant information and alerts medical officers about severe cases. It also recommends 
appropriate responses such as a follow-up visit or phone call. The system can also send suggestions di-
rectly to patients via SMS message or pre-recorded voicemail.

Sponsoring Organization and Partners: ZMQ Software Systems
Application Area: Remote Monitoring
Keeping HIV/AIDS patients informed of their health status is one of the most basic ways of empowering 
them. With that in mind, the Mobile Care, Support and Treatment Manager (MCST) is being created by ZMQ 
Software Systems as an attempt to use technology to improve the logistical challenges of HIV/AIDS man-
agement in developing countries. The solution is conceived as a global model, but ZMQ admits that localiza-
tion and adaptation to rural, urban, and peri-urban contexts will be a challenge. MCST will enable HIV/AIDS 
patients to use their mobile phones to access their lab tests and medical history reports. They can also use 
the system for nutritional planning, create alerts to remind them to take their medication, and connect with 
a help line. In addition, the solution can be used in ‘Group Management’ mode for organizations that work 
with HIV/AIDS patients. ZMQ is currently seeking partners for this project.

ence changes traditional dietary habits. In 2005, engineers at Loughborough University developed a mo-
bile phone health monitoring system to monitor diabetes and other diseases. The system allows doctors 
to use mobile phone networks to monitor up to four key medical signals (electrocardiogram heart signal, 
blood pressure, levels of blood glucose, and oxygen saturation levels) from patients who are on the move. 
Engineers from the UK and India are working to ‘miniaturize the system’ so that sensors are small enough 
to be carried by patients while procuring the necessary biomedical data. In Britain, the solution will be used 
to improve healthcare delivery, while in India it will connect ‘centers of excellence’ to hospitals and clinics in 
more remote areas. Over the next three years, clinical trials will occur in both the United Kingdom and India.

Project 28: Phoned Pill Reminders for TB Treatment
Country: Thailand
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: The Chiang Mai Public Health Department
Application Area: Remote Monitoring
The province of Chiang Mai in northern Thailand has a high number of patients with TB—a major cause of 
death in much of the developing world. A prime reason for high TB mortality rates is the failure of patients 
to take their medications on a regular basis. To combat this trend, the Chiang Mai Public Health Department 
piloted a program involving 60 TB patients who were provided with mobile phones that could only receive 
incoming calls. Patients then received daily reminder calls to take their medication. Dr. Surasing Visrutarana, 
Chief Provincial Health Officer, noted that during a three-month pilot in 2007 the drug-taking consistency 
rate for the patients was over 90%, a significantly higher rate of successful treatment than that observed in 
the province’s standard TB treatment program. The project was not only effective but inexpensive, with a 
cost of just 100 baht ($3) per person.

Project 29: SIMpill Solution for TB
Country: South Africa
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: SIMpill and Tellumat 
Application Area: Remote Monitoring 
Reminders to take daily medication are an effective means to ensure drug regime adherence, which is criti-
cal for diseases like TB, where 99% of those infected can be cured with proper medication compliance. The 
SIMpill solution is designed to help ensure compliance. SIMpill works by equipping a pill bottle with a SIM card 
and transmitter. When the pill bottle is opened, an SMS message is sent to a designated healthcare worker. 
If the pill bottle is not opened when expected, the patient gets a text message reminder to take the medica-
tion. If the patient then fails to comply, the health worker is prompted to call or visit to encourage the taking 
of medication. A 2007 pilot in South Africa to test the system’s efficacy yielded impressive results. The pilot 
showed that with SIMpill, 90% of patients complied with their medication regime, compared to the typical 22 
to 60% compliance rate without the system. The solution is now available worldwide.

Project 30: Virtual Health Pet
Country: Brazil
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: VIDATIS and the Atech Foundation
Application Area: Remote Monitoring 
Virtual Health Pet has taken advantage of the popularity of the Japanese Tamagotchi virtual pets to improve 
medication compliance and patient health in Brazil. The virtual health pet, a J2ME software application running 
on the patient’s mobile phone and linked to an electronic health records system, interacts with the patient 
to remind them to take their medications on time and to monitor their overall health. Alerts are sent out to 
caregivers or emergency services if the patient does not respond to its pet’s messages in a timely manner. 
Because the software is linked to an electronic health records system, the Virtual Health Pet is able to both 
collect patient data and to provide the patient with near real-time information from their medical team. The 
Virtual Health Pet won a Special Jury Award at Simagine 2006, but it is uncertain whether the application is 
currently being deployed in the field.

Project 31: Enhancing Nurses Access for Care Quality and Knowledge 
through Technology (ENACQKT)
Country: The Caribbean
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: The International Development Research Centre (IDRC) 
and the University of Saskatchewan
Application Area: Communication and Training for Health Care Workers
In order for health workers to provide effective patient care, access to timely information is essential. In the 
Caribbean, nurses often lack basic resources, work remotely, and are isolated, which makes data shar-
ing challenging. Enhancing Nurses Access for Care Quality and Knowledge through Technology (ENAC-
QKT) empowers nurses by providing training and other services via PDAs. A key component of ENACQKT 
is building nurses’ capacity through technology instruction, giving them the means to access healthcare 
applications through the PDAs provided by the program. This enhances professional development and 
improves quality of care for patients. Project principals report several achievements, including time savings 
for nurses and greater access to information, particularly in the areas of medication and treatment support. 
The project also reports success in imparting a sense of empowerment to the nurses in terms of speaking 
to physicians about conditions, treatments, and diagnosis.

Khan University (Karachi) and Health and Nutrition Development Society (HANDS)—a Pakistani NGO 
Application Area: Communication and Training for Health Care Workers
One of the chief obstacles to mHealth solutions is lit-
eracy, or the lack thereof. To ensure that semi-literate 
community health workers have access to critical infor-
mation, Microsoft and others are developing HealthLine, 
a speech recognition-based information system. The 
solution is based on Microsoft Speech Server2007 beta 
software. The menu-driven program can be accessed via 
landlines or mobile phones. Callers specify a topic (or dis-
ease) and are walked through a set of menus until they 
reach the information they are seeking. The information 
is then read to them—from a prerecorded message—
in their local language. HealthLine was tested among a 
group of low-literate maternal and child health community 
health workers in Pakistan in mid-2007. It will continue to 
be tested in the field with the results informing new fea-
tures, functionality, and enhancements. Ideally, the solu-
tion will be scaled across Pakistan for maximum impact.

Project 33: Mobile HIV/AIDS Support
Country: Uganda
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: Trinity College Dublin
Application Area: Communication and Training for Health Care Workers
‘Training the trainers’—providing healthcare workers in the field with accessible and reliable medical informa-
tion—is essential for improved health delivery in the developing world. Trinity College Dublin (TCD) is collabo-
rating with the medical school at Makerere Hospital in Kampala, Uganda to explore the potential advantages 
of using PDAs in HIV/AIDS care and treatment. The project aims to provide high-quality medical information 
and advice to healthcare workers in Uganda and throughout sub-Saharan Africa. After an initial needs as-
sessment, the project leaders—a group of academic clinicians from TCD, the Dublin Institute of Technology, 
and North American universities—developed a prototype of a training program on the clinical care, research, 
and prevention of HIV/AIDS. The program was to be evaluated by a select group of healthcare workers in 
the field. Results of the testing and evaluation have not yet been published.

Project 34: Primary Healthcare Nursing Promotion Program
Country: Guatemala
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: The National School for Nurses of Coban (Guatemala), 
Canadian Agency for International Development and the Centre for Nursing Studies (Newfoundland, 
Canada)
Application Area: Communication and Training for Health Care Workers
Nursing shortages, especially in rural areas, are common in developing countries (and increasingly in devel-
oped ones as well). The National School for Nurses of Coban in Guatemala created the Primary Healthcare 
Nursing Promotion Program to increase the number of nursing personnel available to work in rural areas. 
One component of this program is a virtual nursing course, which is taught via a combination of telephone 
and two-way data communications. Of the first virtual nursing course graduates in 2004, a subset became 
‘community tele-facilitators.’ These tele-facilitators were each given a mobile (or satellite) phone, which 
they used to link their rural communities with health specialists in urban areas. The pilot test was launched 
in 2005 in five municipalities in northern Guatemala and covered 150 communities with a total population of 
45,000. At this time, there appears to be continued progress on the virtual nursing training component, but 
it is not certain whether the tele-facilitator program continued after the initial pilot test.

Country: Uganda
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: Uganda Chartered HealthNet (UCH), AED-SATELLIFE, 
Makerere University Medical School, Connectivity Africa and the International Development Research 
Center (IDRC) of Canada
Application Area: Communication and Training for Health Care Workers
Uganda has become a laboratory for efforts to improve two-way data flows between health workers and 
government officials, and the Uganda Health Information Network (UHIN) is a prime example of these ef-
forts. UHIN uses PDAs to collect data and to provide continuing medical education services to physicians. 
The PDAs send and receive messages via infrared beams that send the signals to battery-operated access 
points. The program was launched in 2003 and currently 350 PDAs are being used. They are connected 
to 20 access points in different districts of Uganda. Positive impacts were recorded early on: “The network 
delivered a 25% savings in the first 6 months...health workers using the handheld technology now have bet-
ter job satisfaction and [it] is contributing to staff retention...” The UHIN is planning an analysis to determine 
if the project has had an impact on health outcomes such as healthcare planning, resource allocation, and 
delivery.

Disease and Epidemic Outbreak Tracking 
Project 36: The Acute Encephalitis Syndrome Surveillance Information 
System (AESSIMS)
Country: India
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: Voxiva, Program for Appropriate Technology in Health 
(PATH) and the Government of Andhra Pradesh
Application Area: Disease and Epidemic Outbreak Tracking
Every year, more than two million children die from preventable diseases in the developing world, and mil-
lions more are left impaired. One such culprit, Japanese Encephalitis, a devastating mosquito-borne illness, 
can be prevented by a vaccination, but it is not always administered due to its high cost and a lack of data 
on the disease’s true prevalence and impact. To begin to tackle this problem, the Government of Andhra 
Pradesh, where the disease is endemic, pilot tested an Acute Encephalitis Syndrome Surveillance Informa-
tion Management System (AESSIMS) in one of its districts. Local health workers used mobile phones (or 
web-based technologies) to report incidences of the disease to the AESSIMS system. Decision makers 
could access and analyze this data in real time via a variety of tools, including GIS-based maps. It was en-
visioned that if the pilot test were a success, the AESSIMS system could be rolled out across India and into 
other Asian countries. There is no evidence yet, however, that this project was either scaled up or extended.

Project 37: Alerta DISAMAR
Country: Peru
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: The US Navy, the Peruvian Navy and Voxiva 
Application Area: Disease and Epidemic Outbreak Tracking
When disease outbreaks occur, timely transfer of information is of the essence. Alerta DISAMAR is a dis-
ease surveillance system, based on Voxiva technology, deployed by the Peruvian Navy with support from 
the US Navy. The system’s strength lies in its ‘multi-platform flexibility,’ which allows users to transmit or 
access data through multiple technologies, including mobile phones and the Internet. Alerts of disease out-
breaks are also sent via multiple mechanisms (text messages, voice mail, and e-mail). An evaluation of the 
project conducted in 2003 found that within the first year of deployment, Alerta DISAMAR “rapidly improved 
disease reporting, allowed officials to obtain quality data in real time, and, most importantly, facilitated im-
proved response to disease outbreaks in a remote region.” Since its launch, the system has reported more 
than 80,500 health events over a wide range of medical problems, including diphtheria, yellow fever, snake 
bites, diarrhea, and acute respiratory infections.

Application Area: Education and Awareness, Remote Data Collection, and Disease and Epidemic 
Outbreak Tracking
One of the largest and most ambitious mHealth programs in the world is FrontlineSMS. FrontlineSMS is a 
PC-based software application used for sending and receiving group SMS messages. It allows NGOs to 
run awareness-raising campaigns and competitions, and carry out text-based surveys, or to simply keep in 
touch with fieldworkers and supporters. FrontlineSMS gives access to ‘bulk’ SMS technology designed spe-
cifically with the NGO sector in mind. Although other bulk SMS systems do exist, almost all require reliable 
Internet connectivity—not an option in many developing countries. FrontlineSMS does not require an Internet 
connection and works with any GSM network. The software communicates via a mobile phone or modem, 
which can be attached to a computer with a USB cable. Users are encouraged to share views, experiences, 
and ideas in an online forum and to provide feedback for future versions of the product. 
FrontlineSMS has been used for many healthcare campaigns worldwide including:
Africa-wide: Reporting and monitoring avian flu outbreaks
Benin: Sending health alerts to young people about HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria 
Botswana: Coordinating a blood donation program 
Ecuador: Running surveys among rural healthcare workers and radio listeners
Malawi: Coordinating healthcare workers and collecting data in the field
South Africa: Providing HIV/AIDS information services to teachers

Application Area: Disease and Epidemic Outbreak Tracking
Achieving data and device interoperability is one of the central challenges in improving data collection in 
developing countries. GATHER is a consortium that has developed a set of tools that enable data entry 
from a broad range of devices, including desktops, laptops, telephones, PDAs, GPS systems, and bar-code 
scanners. GATHER’s first field test is currently taking place in Uganda with the collaboration of the Ugandan 
Ministry of Health. Weekly disease surveillance data for 20 health clinics is being collected by mobile phone 
and sent to a GATHER server located at the Health Ministry’s Department of Epidemiology. The results of the 
Ugandan field test will inform future phases of GATHER development. The developers hope the technology will 
be ready for broader deployment by late 2009.

Sponsoring Organization and Partners: St. John’s Medical College (Bangalore), Indian Institute of 
Management (Bangalore) and Encore Software
Application Area: Disease and Epidemic Outbreak Tracking
Disease outbreaks often start in small clusters. Technology can play a crucial role in quickly detecting and 
containing initial outbreaks so that broader spread of communicable disease can be prevented. In India, 
Shashank Garg and Dr. Isha Garg have created Handhelds for Health, a social enterprise that is developing an 
open source disease surveillance system. With this system, health workers will be able to use mobile devices 
to collect, validate, and transmit data to a centralized server. The server will be accessible to resident experts, 
who can use the real-time data to rapidly identify disease trends and make informed public health decisions. 
Handhelds for Health will also be able to track non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, that require 
continual medical attention and follow-up. The founders further hope to use the solution to collect and trans-
mit the data required for large, community-based, longitudinal studies of diseases and other health issues.

Project 41: Remote Interaction, Consultation, and Epidemiology (RICE)
Country: Vietnam
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: Microsoft Corporation, Thayer School of Engineering at 
Dartmouth College and the National Hospital of Pediatrics (Hanoi)
Application Area: Disease and Epidemic Outbreak Tracking
 
Rural locales in China and Southeast Asia have been identified as potential high-risk areas for SARS and avian 
influenza transmission. The Remote Interaction, Consultation, and Epidemiology (RICE) telemedicine system 
will include a disease tracking component to facilitate the early detection of such communicable diseases. 
Through mobile technology, RICE will also enable “remote medical consultation, epidemiological surveillance 
and access to medical knowledge in regions of the world without access to computers or the Internet.” Most 
of the interactions among the rural clinics, regional hospitals, and national hospitals will be conducted via 
smartphones. A pilot test of the RICE solution was conducted in March 2007 in Vietnam. Volunteers from Dart-
mouth tested the connection between clinics and hospitals in rural areas and the National Hospital of Pediat-
rics (NHP) in Hanoi. The researchers also investigated the information needs of rural clinics to inform continu-
ing development of the solution.

Project 42: Tamil Nadu Health Watch 
Country: India
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: Voxiva
Application Area: Disease and Epidemic Outbreak Tracking
Following the devastating 2004 tsunami, the US-based technology company Voxiva deployed a phone- and 
web-based data collection and disease surveillance system in India’s hard-hit Tamil Nadu state. The ‘Health 
Watch’ program, launched in May 2005, makes use of existing communications infrastructure (i.e., mo-
bile phones, fixed-line phones, and the Internet) to allow health workers in remote areas to report disease 
incidence data to health officials in real time. The program also allows health professionals in distant medi-
cal centers to quickly analyze and share information and resources, and to adequately respond to specific 
health-related questions. For the Tamil Nadu project, over 300 primary health center doctors were trained 
by Voxiva. The interactive training sessions featured simple, easy-to-use bilingual manuals. Training was 
coordinated with local authorities so that disease surveillance and outbreak response protocols were pro-
moted and reinforced.

Application Area: Diagnostic and Treatment Support
Dimagi and its partners have been working since 2005 on a software program for handheld mobile devices 
that will help field health workers screen HIV/AIDS patients and determine their medical needs. Dimagi is 
partnering with the Harvard University Program for AIDS (HUPA) to develop the solution. A three-month pilot 
program was implemented in several hospitals in Tygerberg, South Africa. For this pilot, health workers were 
able to use any Windows Mobile 5 device, including most PDA’s and Windows Mobile-based smartphones. 
The software was designed to be sensitive to local needs, providing support in several local languages and 
a general user-friendly experience. Data were entered and stored in an embedded MySQL database, and 
then synchronized with a host computer via Internet or USB connection. Though this project focused on 
HIV/AIDS screening, the software and devices could be modified to assist with screening for other illnesses, 
or with triage and diagnosis.

Country: Tanzania
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: Dimagi, Inc. (privately held software company), D-Tree 
International, the Rockefeller Foundation, WHO and the Jerre D. Noe Professorship 
Application Area: Diagnostic and Treatment Support 
Often, health protocols are instituted but implementation falls short due to lack of resources in developing 
countries. D-Tree International, Dimagi, and other partners conducted a joint study that used PDAs to im-
prove adherence to the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) protocols in rural Tanzania. The 
WHO and UNICEF developed the IMCI as part of their strategy of combating some of the most common 
diseases afflicting children in the developing world. While the IMCI has shown positive results in Tanzania, a 
lack of adequate supervision, insufficient training, and less-than-rigorous implementation have weakened its 
potential impact. The project’s research team attempted to address these problems by creating a program 
called e-IMCI, which runs on a PDA and guides health workers through the IMCI process with step-by-step 
instructions. The pilot results for e-IMCI were encouraging, suggesting that the technology employed is  
user-friendly enough for clinicians to use, and that both patient care and caregiver efficiency can be im-
proved. Larger-scale and long-term studies are needed to bolster this argument, but early indicators are 
positive.

Application Area: Diagnostic and Treatment Support
Providing adequate health services in all locales in Indonesia, like most island states, is extremely chal-
lenging. To overcome this challenge, a large number of technical and health-oriented organizations are 
collaborating on a prototype mobile telemedicine system. The system will enable remote consultation and 
diagnostics and also facilitate the collection of patient data. Depending on the communications infrastruc-
ture available at a specific location—radio, mobile, or landline phones, and the Internet—information will be 
shared between patients at ‘mobile telemedicine units’ and doctors at ‘medical service centers.’ As a first 
step, researchers conducted field surveys in West Java to inventory health and communications infra-
structure. The results of these surveys informed the prototype development. Further enhancements to 
the system are being made and the team reports that “the project is challenging” as it integrates so many 
disciplines and technologies.

using any telephone (mobile, satellite, or fixed-line telephone systems—personal or public) or Internet tech-
nology. A centralized database hosts all of this data and allows for real-time access. Through Nacer, the en-
tire health ecosystem can send and receive information in order to monitor patient health, provide referrals 
and follow-up care, and track supplies and disease outbreaks. Madhu Krishna of Voxiva claims that, “should 
health personnel report symptoms that are indicative of a serious, underlying health condition in a pregnant 
woman, regional health workers can review her records and send voicemail messages and other support to 
ensure the woman is receiving appropriate care.”

Project 51: TeleDoc – Jiva Healthcare Project
Country: India
Sponsoring Organization and Partners: The Soros Foundation and Jiva Institute 
Application Area: Diagnostic and Treatment Support
A shortage of doctors spells inadequate treatment for many in the developing world, especially in remote 
rural areas. Connecting health workers in rural areas with doctors through mobile technology is a promis-
ing solution to this endemic problem. TeleDoc uses Java-enabled mobile phones to connect village-based 
healthcare workers with doctors in urban areas for remote diagnosis and treatment. Doctors receive real-
time diagnostic information entered by the healthcare workers and prescribe appropriate treatments. Tele-
Doc field workers prepare any prescribed medicines at regional offices. These medications are delivered 
directly to the home of patients in rural areas by a combination of pharmacies and delivery personnel. In 
the spring of 2003, TeleDoc was tested in 15 villages in Haryana, India. The program won the World Summit 
Award for eHealth at the World Summit on the Information Society in Geneva in 2003, and has aggressive 
plans for expansion.
