What	is	the	CDE	Club?
Managing	your	diabetes	can	often	be	a	struggle,	trying	to	balance	eating,	medication	and	physical	activity.	We	as	the	CDE
appreciate	this	struggle	and	therefore	want	to	make	living	with	diabetes	a	little	easier.	If	this	sounds	good,	then	let	us
introduce	to	you	the	CDE	Club.
The	Four	Foundations	of	the	CDE	Club
Learn
To	provide	you	with	the	highest	quality	information	regarding	diabetes	and	other	health	related	matters.	No	longer	do
you	have	to	sift	through	the	millions	of	articles	on	the	web	that	just	leave	most	of	us	confused	and	frustrated.
Act
Information	is	often	not	enough	to	change	one's	behavior.	For	example,	most	of	us	know	that	we	should	exercise,	but
getting	up	in	the	morning	to	go	for	a	walk	is	often	a	huge	battle!	The	CDE	Club	will	provide	you	a	few	suggested	actions
that	can	have	a	huge	impact	on	your	health.
Share
To	be	able	to	share	with	others	not	only	information	but	your	success	story.
Rewards
So	you	have	achieved	your	goals,	now	it	is	time	to	reward	yourself.	The	CDE	Club	will	be	rewarding	ANYONE	for
achieving	his	or	her	goals.	From	the	smallest	goals	to	the	biggest	there	is	a	reward	waiting	for	you.
Who	can	join?
