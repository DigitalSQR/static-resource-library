Improving the quality of child health care at the primary level 
through integrated decision-support tools
Malawi is among nine low-income countries that successfully reduced its under-five mortality rate by 60 
percent or more between 1990 and 2011.1, 2 Despite this progress, large numbers of children continue to 
die unnecessarily from conditions that are easily preventable and treatable.  A large proportion of children 
in Malawi are still at increased risk of mortality due to common childhood infections. The leading causes 
of under-five mortality in Malawi are malaria (13 percent),  AIDS (13 percent), pneumonia (11 percent), 
diarrhea (7 percent), and neonatal conditions (31 percent). The Ministry of Health (MOH) has been 
collaborating with partners to scale up a package of high-impact interventions to reduce under-five child 
mortality since 2007 under the Accelerated Child Survival and Development (ACSD) strategy. These 
efforts have included integrated community case management (iCCM) in hard-to-reach (HTR) areas to 
complement fixed or scheduled facility-based services. To improve the quality of care provided to under-
five children, D-tree International is providing mHealth to support the implementation of iCCM.
